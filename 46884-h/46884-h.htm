<p>The volume now published explains in its first part an
hypothesis that the human race has descended from some
ape-like stock by a series of changes which began and, until
recently, were maintained by the practice of hunting in pack
for animal food, instead of being content with the fruits and
other nutritious products of the tropical forest. The hypothesis
occurred to me many years ago, and was first published
(in brief) in <cite>The Metaphysics of Nature</cite> (1805), Chap. <abbr class="no-it" title="13">XIII.</abbr>,
and again in <cite>Natural and Social Morals</cite> (1909); but all it
implied did not become clear until, in lecturing on Comparative
Psychology, there was forced upon me the necessity of effecting
an intelligible transition from the animal to the human mind,
and of not being satisfied to say year after year that hands
and brains were plainly so useful that they must have been
developed by Natural Selection. Then one day the requisite
ideas came to light; and an outline of the hypothesis was read
at the Meeting of the British Association (Section H) at
Birmingham in 1913, and printed in <cite>Man</cite>, November 1914.
The Council of the Anthropological Institute has kindly consented
to my using the substance of that article in the first
chapter here following.</p>

<p>The article in <cite>Man</cite> dealt chiefly with the physical changes
which our race has undergone. The correlative mental
changes were explained in the <cite>British Journal of Psychology</cite>
in an article which supplies the basis of the second chapter
of this book.</p>

<p>The hunting-pack, then, was the first form of human society;
and in lecturing on Ethnopsychology two questions especially
interested me: (1) Under what mental conditions did the
change take place from the organisation of the hunting-pack
(when this weakened) to the settled life of the tribe or group?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and (2) Why is the human mind everywhere befogged with
ideas of Magic and Animism? They seemed at last to have
the same answer: these superstitions were useful and (apparently)
even necessary in giving to elders enough prestige to
preserve tradition and custom when the leader of the hunt
was no longer conspicuous in authority. A magic-working
gerontocracy was the second form of society; and the third
form was governed by a wizard-king or a priest-king, or by a
king supported by wizards or priests. One must, therefore,
understand the possibility of these beliefs in Magic and
Animism, and how they arose and obtained a hold upon all
tribes and nations; and hence the second part of this volume—on
Superstition.</p>

<p>Some results of inquiry into these matters were also published
in the <cite>British Journal of Psychology</cite> (namely, much of
the substance of Chaps. <abbr class="no-it" title="3">III.</abbr>, <abbr class="no-it" title="4">IV.</abbr>, <abbr class="no-it" title="5">V.</abbr>, <abbr class="no-it" title="6">VI.</abbr>, and <abbr class="no-it" title="8">VIII.</abbr>) and are
here reproduced, with the editor’s consent, enlarged and, for
the most part, rewritten: the least altered are Chaps. <abbr class="no-it" title="6">VI.</abbr> and
<abbr class="no-it" title="8">VIII.</abbr> Chaps. <abbr class="no-it" title="7">VII.</abbr>, <abbr class="no-it" title="9">IX.</abbr> and <abbr class="no-it" title="10">X.</abbr> have not hitherto been
printed; but part of Chap. <abbr class="no-it" title="10">X.</abbr> was read at the Meeting of the
British Association at Bournemouth last year.</p>

<p>Messrs. Williams and Norgate have given permission to
use the diagram in the footnote to p. 3, based on one of Prof.
Keith’s in his <cite>Antiquity of Man</cite>.</p>

<p>Extensive use has, of course, been made of the works of
Darwin, Herbert Spencer and E.&nbsp;B. Tylor, and (among living
authors) of the volumes of Sir J.&nbsp;G. Frazer and Prof. Ed.
Westermarck. I am grateful to my friends and colleagues,
Prof. Spearman, Prof. J.&nbsp;P. Hill and Prof. Arthur Keith for
assistance in various ways. Mr. Pycraft, too, of the Natural
History Museum has given me important information; and
my old friend, Mr. Thomas Whittaker, has helped me, as
usual, when my need was greatest.</p>

<p class="ttl1">THE ORIGIN OF MAN AND OF
HIS SUPERSTITIONS</p>


<h2 class="fst"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<br />ON THE DIFFERENTIATION OF MAN FROM THE
ANTHROPOIDS</h2>


<h3><a id="ch01_01"></a>§ 1. The Hypothesis</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the human species as we now see it, with its several
races, Mongolian, Negro, Mediterranean, etc., represents a
Family of the Primates is generally agreed; and there is
evidence that the Family formerly comprised other species
that have become extinct. Our nearest surviving zoological
relatives are the Gorilla, Chimpanzee and Orang, and (at a
further remove) the Siamang and Gibbons; and in spite of
the fundamental anatomical resemblance between those
apes and ourselves, the difference is so great that some
explanation of how it came about is very desirable.</p>

<p>The differences between Man and his nearest relatives are
innumerable; but taking the chief of them, and assuming
that the minor details are correlated with these, it is the
hypothesis of this essay that they may all be traced to the
influence of one variation operating amongst the original
anthropoid conditions. That variation was the adoption
of a flesh-diet and the habits of a hunter in order to obtain
it. Without the adoption of a flesh-diet there could have
been no hunting; but a flesh-diet obtained without hunting
(supposing it possible) could have done nothing for the
evolution of our stock. The adoption of the hunting-life,
therefore, is the essential variation upon which everything
else depends. We need not suppose that a whole ancestral
species varied in this way: it is enough that a few, or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
one, of the common anthropoid stock should have done so,
and that the variation was advantageous and was inherited.</p>

<p>Such a variation <em>must</em> have occurred at some time, since
Man is everywhere more or less carnivorous; the earliest
known men were hunters; weapons are among the earliest
known artefacts. And it is not improbable that the change
began at the anthropoid level; because although extant
anthropoids are mainly frugivorous, yet they occasionally
eat birds’-eggs and young birds; the gorilla has been said
to eat small mammals; and other Primates (cebidæ, macaques
and baboons) eat insects, arachnids, crabs, worms,
frogs, lizards, birds; and the crab-eating macaque collects
a large portion of its food on the Malay littoral. Why, then,
should not one ape have betaken itself to hunting?</p>

<p>We need not suppose that our ancestors were ever exclusively
carnivorous: that is very unlikely. A mixed diet is
the rule even amongst hunting tribes, and everywhere the
women collect and consume fruits and roots. But if at first
nearly omnivorous, our ancestor (it is assumed) soon preferred
to attack mammals, and advanced at a remote date
to the killing of the biggest game found in his habitat. Everywhere
savage hunters do so now: the little Semang kills the
tiger, rhinoceros, elephant and buffalo; and many thousands
of years ago, in Europe men slew the reindeer and the
mammoth, the horse and the bison, the hyæna and the
cave-bear. It is true they had weapons and snares, whilst
the first hunter had only hands and teeth.</p>

<p>The change from a fruit-eating to a hunting life subserved
the great utility of opening fresh supplies of food; and,
possibly, a failure of the normal supply of the old customary
food was the direct cause of the new habit. If our ape lived
near the northern limits of the tropical forest, and a fall of
temperature there took place, such as to reduce (especially
in winter) the yield of fruit and other nutritious vegetation
on which he had subsisted, famine may have driven him to
attack other animals;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> whilst more southerly anthropoids,
not suffering from the change of climate, continued in their
ancient manner of life. A large anthropoid (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dryopithecus</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
inhabited Central Europe in the Miocene, for his bones have
been found; there may have been others; and during that
period the climate altered from sub-tropical to temperate,
with corresponding changes in fauna and flora. Hence it
formerly occurred to me that perhaps the decisive change in
the life of our Family happened there and then. It seems,
however, that good judges put the probable date of the great
differentiation much earlier, in the Oligocene;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and since
I cannot find that any extensive alteration of climate is
known to have happened during that period, it seems necessary
to fall back upon “spontaneous” variation (as one must
in many other cases); that is to say, from causes which are
at present beyond our vision, the fateful ape did, in fact,
prefer animal food so decidedly as to begin a-hunting for it.
That being granted, the rest of the history was inevitable.
The new pursuit was of a nature to engross the animal’s
whole attention and co-ordinate all his faculties; and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
maintain and reinforce it, his structure in body and mind may
reasonably be supposed to have undergone rapid modification
by natural selection; because those individuals that were in
any organ or faculty best adapted to the new life had an
advantage, which was inherited and gradually intensified.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<h3><a id="ch01_02"></a>§ 2. What the Hypothesis Explains</h3>

<p>Let me run rapidly through the chief differences between
Man and his nearest congeners: some of them are obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and can be stated very briefly; others I shall return to in
the next chapter. We shall see that they all follow naturally
from the above hypothesis.</p>

<p>(1) The anthropoids are never found out of the tropical
forests of Africa and Malaya (including Borneo and Sumatra).
They feed chiefly on the fruits and other highly nutritious
vegetable products that, all the year round, are only there
obtainable. Although often coming to the ground, especially
the chimpanzee and gorilla, they are adapted to living in
the trees: that is their home. In contrast with their habits,
Man is at home on the ground, with unlimited range over the
whole planet from beyond the Arctic Circle to Tasmania
and Tierra del Fuego; because on the ground (chiefly) he
everywhere finds his food in the other animals whom he hunts
and slays. This, then, is the condition of his emancipation
from the tropical forest. It is, indeed, conceivable that a
frugivorous animal, originally of the forest, should obtain
a wider range by taking to a coarser diet of roots and herbage,
such as suffices the Ungulates, browsing or grazing or digging
with their snouts; but this would not have led to the upright
gait, or the big brain, or any of the marks that distinguish
Man. Not advance but retrogression must have followed
such a change.</p>

<p>(2) That the earliest men of whose condition of life we have
any knowledge were hunters agrees with the hypothesis.
Any other view of Man’s origin must explain how and when
he became a hunter. There seems to be no reason to put
the change of habits (which certainly occurred at some time)
anywhere nearer than the beginning of our differentiation.
The further we put it back the better it explains other
modifications.</p>

<p>(3) The erect attitude was reached by the apes in the
course of adaptation to arboreal life;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but the erect gait as
the normal mode of progression is (if we neglect the gibbons’
imperfect performance) peculiar to ourselves; and such a
gait was attained because the most successful hunters
followed their prey afoot upon the ground. The feeble
ineffective shuffle of the anthropoids upon the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
supporting themselves with their arms where there are no
overhanging boughs to swing by and help themselves along,
could not have served the hunter, especially if he was to
leave the forest. We may, indeed, suppose that at first
prey was sometimes attacked by leaping upon it from the
branch of a tree, as leopards sometimes do; but the less our
ancestor in his new career trusted to trees the better for him.
Such simple strategy could not make him a dominant animal
throughout the world; nothing could do this but the gradual
attainment of erect gait adapted to running down his prey.
Hence the numerous modifications of structure necessary to
it, whenever from time to time they occurred, were preserved
and accumulated by natural selection: namely, the curving
of the vertebral column, the balancing of the head upon a
relatively slender neck, changes in the joints, bones and
muscles of the legs, the lengthening of the leg and the specialisation
of the foot (in which the heel is developed more than
in the gorilla, and the great toe is lengthened and lies parallel
with the other toes).</p>

<p>(4) The specialisation of the legs and feet, as it proceeded,
made possible the specialisation of the hands: being gradually
rid of the task of assisting locomotion, whether in trees
or on the ground, they were used in grappling with prey,
seconded by massive jaws and powerful canine teeth. In
course of time they brought cudgels and stones to the encounter,
and after many ages began to alter such means of
offence into weapons that might be called artefacts. These
simple beginnings probably occupied an immense time,
perhaps more than half of the total period down to the
present. The utility and consequent selection of hands had
been great throughout; but their final development may be
referred to the making and using of weapons fashioned
according to a mental pattern. Those who had the best
hands were selected because they made the best weapons
and used them best; but we know from remains of several
palæolithic stages of the art of manufacturing implements
how very slowly the art improved.</p>

<p>(5) Along with specialisation of the hands went a reduction
in the length and massiveness of the arms; and this must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
have been disadvantageous in directly grappling with prey.
But it was necessary to the runner in order to lessen the weight
and cumbersomeness of the upper part of the body and to
improve his balance and agility. The change may also
have been beneficial by affording physiological compensation
for the lengthening and strengthening of the legs. And as
soon as unwrought stones and clubs came into use there was
mechanical compensation for the shortening of the arms.
The result is an adaptive co-ordination of the total structure
to the life of a two-footed hunter.</p>

<p>(6) Darwin says: “The early male forefathers of Man
were, as previously stated, probably furnished with great
canine teeth; but as they gradually acquired the habit of
using stones, clubs, or other weapons, for fighting with their
enemies or rivals, they would use their jaws and teeth less
and less. In this case the jaws, together with the teeth,
would become reduced in size, as we may feel almost sure
from numerous analogous cases.”</p>

<p>(7) Hence the profile began to approach the orthognathous
type; and it progressed further in that direction on account
of accompanying changes in the skull. The skull became
less thick and rough, (<i>a</i>) because, as the hands (using weapons)
superseded the teeth in fighting, jaws and neck grew less
massive, and their muscles no longer needed such solid
attachments; (<i>b</i>) because the head was less liable to injury
when no longer used as the chief organ in combat. At the
same time the skull slowly increased in capacity and became
vaulted to make room for the brains of an animal, which
(as we shall see) acquired much knowledge (parietal association
area) and lived by the application of its knowledge to
the co-ordination of increasingly complex and continuous
activities (anterior association area).<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>(8) Monkeys of most species, whether in the New World or
in the Old, are social, living in bands of from ten to fifty
or more, and may co-operate occasionally in mutual defence
or in keeping watch. Baboons, indeed, are seen in herds
of several hundreds; and they are credibly reported to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
co-operate in raiding plantations, and in defending themselves
against leopards, other baboons and even human hunters.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Gibbons, again, are social, going in bands to the number of
fifty. But the large anthropoids live only in families—the
male orang being even of a somewhat solitary habit; three
or four families of chimpanzees may for a time associate
together. Man, however, is everywhere—with a few doubtful
exceptions, probably degenerate—both social and co-operative;
and the purpose of his co-operation at the level
of the Australian or the Semang is instructive. It is not, as
we might suppose, in industry, but in hunting, war, or tribal
ceremonies that tribesmen work together—the last no doubt
of comparatively recent origin: so that a few thousand years
ago there was no co-operation except hunting and war
(which come to the same thing).</p>

<p>That the large anthropoids are neither gregarious nor
co-operative follows from their having no task in which co-operation
would be useful, no common purpose: they are
able alone to defend themselves and their families; and
when families range apart through the woods their food is
in better supply. But the ancestor of Man found an object
for association and co-operation in the chase. Spencer,
indeed, says that a large carnivore, capable of killing its own
prey, profits by being solitary; and this may be true where
game is scarce: in the Oligocene and Miocene periods game
was not scarce. Moreover, when our ape first pursued
game, especially big game (not being by ancient adaptation
in structure and instinct a carnivore), he may have been,
and probably was, incapable of killing enough prey single-handed;
and, if so, he will have profited by becoming both
social and co-operative as a hunter, like the wolves and dogs—in
short, a sort of wolf-ape (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lycopithecus</i>). The pack
was a means of increasing the supply of food per unit; and
gregariousness increased by natural selection up to the limit
set by utility. Hence (as will be shown at length in the
next chapter) Man is in character more like a dog or a wolf
than he is like any other animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>(9) Some development of the rudiments of speech may be
confidently traced to social co-operation. The gibbon,
most social, is also the most vocal of anthropoids; but
having no common task in which united action is necessary,
he uses his remarkable power of voice (apparently) merely
to express his feelings and to keep the troop together. The
chimpanzee and the gorilla enjoy probably a close and
affectionate family life, but one that makes little or no demand
for concerted effort. Hence their vocalisation is very rudimentary.
According to R.&nbsp;L. Garner, it is true speech: a
chimpanzee (he says) knows the meaning of the sounds he
makes, and intends to convey it to some definite individual
at whom he looks. But he has at command very few sounds,
and those mainly expressive of natural wants.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> If it be
urged that anthropoids do not talk because their lower jaw
and tongue have not the special adaptation to speech that
is found in Man, it should be considered (<i>a</i>) that if such
structure had been useful to them it would have been
acquired, as at some time it must have been by Man himself;
and (<i>b</i>) that even without any change they might have
jabbered well enough to convey a good many discriminated,
objective meanings if they had needed to do so: for Man
must have begun in that way; he cannot have waited for
the development of physical structure before trying to talk.
Sufficient intelligence is not wanting to chimpanzees; for in
captivity they learn to understand a good deal that is said
to them. What they wanted was a sufficient motive for
persistently trying to communicate, such that those who
made any progress in the art had a living advantage over
others. Man had such a motive; because co-operation was
necessary to him, not (as we have seen) in industry, but in
hunting. In hunting, in planning and directing the hunt,
speech is plainly useful; and it is better than gesture, which
probably preceded, and generally accompanied it; because,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
as speech became independent of gesture, it could go on
whilst the hands and body were otherwise employed, or where
comrades could not see one another—transferring, by a very
profitable division of labour, the whole business of expression
to organs not otherwise needed. It may not be much more
than very simple beginnings of articulate speech that can be
traced to early co-operative hunting; but in the beginning
lies the whole difficulty. And the situation was particularly
favourable to the beginning of language by onomatopœia,
imitating the characteristic noises of different animals and
of the weapons and actions employed in pursuing and slaying
them.</p>

<p>(10) The intelligence and extensive knowledge (compared
with anthropoids) that distinguish Man in his lowest known
condition are clearly accounted for by his adoption of the
hunting life. Already (as we may assume) the most intelligent
of living animals, with great knowledge of the forest,
he had everything to learn about the world beyond the forest
as soon as he ventured into it, and everything to learn about
the art of hunting. Depending chiefly upon sight and hearing,
he had to learn by observation, and to remember, and to
apply all and more than all that the carnivore knows and
does instinctively, or learns by following its mother. He
must have learned to discriminate all sorts of animals, many
of them new in a strange country; their reactions to himself,
manner of flight, or of attack, or defence; the spoor of each
and its noises; its habits and haunts, where it reposed or
went to drink, where to set snares or lie in wait for it. Advancing
to the use of weapons, he must have adapted them
to his prey; he must have discovered the best materials—wood,
or stone, or bone—for making weapons, the best
materials for snares, and where to find such things. He
must have fixed in his mind this series: game, weapons, the
making of them, materials, where found; and must have
learned to attend to the items of the series in the necessary
order without impatience or confusion: a task far beyond the
power of any other animal.</p>

<p>Further, the hunting life supplied a stimulus that had
formerly been wanting to our ape. There is some difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in comprehending why the anthropoid should be as intelligent
as he is; and, similarly, it seemed to Wallace that the savage
has intelligence above his needs—“in his large and well-developed
brain he possesses an organ quite disproportionate
to his actual requirements.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This illusion results from our
not reflecting that the first task of increasing intelligence is
to deal appropriately with details in greater and greater
number and variety, and that the details of their life, with
both savage and anthropoid, are just what we cannot appreciate.
Still, the anthropoid seems to have a rather lazy
time of it: especially, he seems to have hardly any occasion
for following out a purpose needing some time for its accomplishment.
This powerful stimulus the hunting life applies
to carnivores, above all to dogs and wolves; and in the same
way it affected our ape: compelling him to combine many
activities for a considerable period of time, along with his
fellows, and direct them to one end in the actual hunting,
and (later) to prosecute still other activities for a longer
period in preparing weapons and snares to make the hunting
more effective. Add to these considerations the development
of gesture and rudiments of speech, exacting intelligence
for their acquisition and increasing intelligence by their
attainment, and the superiority of the lowest savage to an
anthropoid is sufficiently explained. Severe must have been
the selection of those that were capable of such progress,
and correspondingly rapid the advance and differentiation
of the species.</p>

<p>(11) Using stones as weapons, and finding that broken
stones do most damage, and breaking them for that purpose,
the progressive hunter necessarily makes some sparks fly;
and if these fall amongst dry leaves or grass, he may light a
fire. “In making flint implements sparks would be produced;
in polishing them it would not fail to be observed
that they became hot; and in this way it is easy to see
how the two methods of making fire may have originated.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
But if the production of fire by friction had been suggested
by the polishing of flints, it could hardly have been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
before the neolithic stage; whereas hearths are known of
much earlier date. And it may have happened earlier
whilst some one was polishing an arrow or a spear with
another piece of wood: a supposition which dispenses with
the long inference from a warm flint to a flaming stick. It
is a curious fact that to this day in Australia fire is sometimes
made by rubbing a spear-thrower upon a shield;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> but I lay
no stress upon this, as if such a practice must be traditionary
from the earliest discovery of the method. Either in the
chipping of flints or in the polishing of spears it is far easier,
and a more probable way, to learn the art of making fire
than by observing that dried boughs or bamboos driven
together by the wind sometimes catch fire; because those
processes include the very actions which the art employs:
imitation of nature is not called for. It is true that the natives
of Nukufetan in the South Seas explain the discovery of fire
by their having seen smoke arise from two crossed branches
of a tree shaken in the wind;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but this, probably, is merely
the speculation of some Polynesian philosopher. Volcanoes,
too, have been pointed out as a possible source of fire; and,
in the myth, Demeter is said to have lit her torches at the
crater of Ætna—an action fit for a goddess. But were
such an origin of fire conceivable with savages, it would not
show how they came to make it themselves. Fire at first
must have excited terror. Until uses were known for fire
no one could have ventured to fetch it from a volcano, nor
to make it by imitating the friction of boughs in the wind.
Fires were accidentally lit by man again and again, and much
damage done, before he could learn (<i>a</i>) the connection of
events, (<i>b</i>) the uses of fire, (<i>c</i>) purposely to produce it, (<i>d</i>) how
to control it. The second and fourth of these lessons are
much more difficult than the mere making of fire; they are
essential, yet generally overlooked. It seems necessary to
suppose a series of accidents at each step, in order to show
the effects of fire in hardening wood, hollowing wood, cooking
game, baking and (later) glazing clay, and so forth. Perhaps
a prairie-fire disclosed the advantages of cooking game, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
many a prairie was afterwards burnt to that end before a
more economical plan was discovered. As to the effect of
fire on clay, Lord Avebury observes that clay-vessels may
have been invented by (1) plastering gourds or coco-nuts
with clay to resist the fire when boiling water in them;
(2) observing the effect of fire on the clay; (3) leaving out
the vegetable part.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This must have been a comparatively
recent discovery; though there is some evidence of pottery
having been made by palæolithic man. It is impossible to
say when fire was discovered; but it was certainly known to
the Mousterian culture—say, 50,000 years ago: probably
very much earlier; and it was made by hunters.</p>


<h3><a id="ch01_03"></a>§ 3. Minor and Secondary Consequences</h3>

<p>(1) The extensive adoption by Man of a flesh-diet many
hundreds of thousands of years ago might be expected to have
shortened his alimentary canal in comparison with that of
the anthropoids; but not much evidence of it is obtainable.
Topinard, giving a proportionate estimate, says that in Man
it is about six times the length of the body, in the gibbon
about eight times. Dr. Arthur Keith, in a private communication
with which he has favoured me, says that the
adult chimpanzee’s intestine is slightly longer than the
adult man’s, but that the measurements are for certain reasons
unsatisfactory, and that there have not been enough measurements
of adult chimpanzees. We must remember that, on
the one hand, the chimpanzee is not exclusively frugivorous,
and that, on the other hand, it is not likely that Man has
been at any time exclusively carnivorous; though the return
of large populations to a vegetarian diet by means of
agriculture is recent.</p>

<p>(2) Man has lost the restraint of seasonal marriage, common
to the anthropoids with other animals, as determined
by food-supply and other conditions of infantile welfare;
though, according to Prof. Westermarck, traces of it may
still be found in a few tribes.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> That our domestic carnivores
have also lost this wholesome restraint on passion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
population points, probably, to some condition of a steadier
food-supply as determining or permitting the change amongst
ourselves. No growth of prudence, however, or habit of
laying up stores can explain the steadier supply of food;
since the lower savages have no prudence and no stores.
On the whole, the change may be attributed (<i>a</i>) to an omnivorous
habit being more steadily gratified than one entirely
frugivorous or carnivorous; (<i>b</i>) to our ancestors having
wandered in quest of game from country to country in which
the seasons varied, so that the original correspondence of
birth-time with favourable conditions of welfare was thrown
out. There may also have been causes that kept down the
normal numbers of the pack, so as to be equivalent, in scarce
seasons, to more abundant food: the hunter’s life, whilst
securing a richer normal diet, involved many destructive
incidents. And this (by the way) was favourable to rapid
selection and adaptation; though if the destruction had been
great enough to counterbalance the advantages of animal
food, it must have frustrated the whole experiment.</p>

<p>(3) There is one characteristic difference of Man from the
anthropoids which his hunting habits do not clearly explain—his
relatively naked skin. Darwin attributed this condition
to sexual selection.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He argued that, on the one hand, so
far as Man has had the power of choice, women have been
chosen for their beauty; and that, on the other hand, women
have had more power of selection, even in the savage state,
than is usually supposed, and “would generally choose not
merely the handsomest men, according to their standard of
taste, but those who were at the same time best able to
defend and support them.” Hence, if a partial loss of hair
was esteemed ornamental by our ape-like progenitors, sexual
selection, operating age after age, might result in relative
nakedness. “The faces of several species of monkey and
large surfaces at the posterior end of the body have been
denuded of hair; and this we may safely attribute to sexual
selection.” The beard of the male, and the great length of
the hair of the head in some races, especially seem due to
this cause. The greater hairiness of Europeans, compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
with other races, may be a case of reversion to remote ancestral
conditions. But as all races are nearly naked, the
common character was probably acquired before the several
races had diverged from the common stock.</p>

<p>The species of monkey that have lost the hair on various
parts of their bodies, and the beard of males (together with
the longer head-hair of women) of our own race are cases
that strongly support the ascription of such secondary sexual
characters to sexual selection. Yet, going back to the time
before the division of modern Man into races (say, 600,000
years), it seems incredible that any women then went unmarried,
hair or no hair, if they were healthy (and the
unhealthy soon ceased to exist); or that any man went
unmarried, if he could do his share in the hunting-field
(and, if not, he also soon ceased to exist). No facts
observed amongst extant savages—the choice exerted by
women, or the polygamy of chiefs—throw much light upon
that ancient state of affairs. There were then no chiefs:
the hunt-leader of pack or clan had no authority but his
personal prowess, no tradition of ancestry or religion, nor
probably the prestige of magic, to give him command of
women. Unless, at that time, relative nakedness was strongly
correlated with personal prowess in the male and efficiency
in the female, it is difficult to understand how it can have
been preserved and increased by sexual selection. Forgive me
for adding an unkind remark: if the selection of women for
their beauty has gone on for hundreds of thousands of years,
and has had a cumulative effect upon the race, is not the
result disappointing? Go into the street and look. That
“women have become more beautiful, according to the
general opinion, than men,” is not an objective, truly
æsthetic judgment, but one determined by causes of which
“general opinion” is falsely unconscious. Schopenhauer<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
thought that men are better looking than women; and of
average specimens this seems to be true; though, to be sure,
he was a sort of misogynist.</p>

<p>Another explanation of Man’s nakedness was suggested
by Thomas Belt, based on the parallel case of certain races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of naked dogs, namely, that he is the better able to free
himself from parasites.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Darwin mentions this hypothesis
and, in a footnote, cites in its favour “a practice with the
Australians, when the vermin get troublesome, to singe
themselves”; but he says, in the text, “whether this evil
is of sufficient magnitude to have led to the denudation of
the body through natural selection, may be doubted, since
none of the many quadrupeds inhabiting the tropics have,
as far as I know, acquired any specialised means of relief.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
It appears, too, that against the probability of such a result
must be set the actual disadvantage of nakedness, as insisted
upon by Wallace, who says that savages feel the want of
protection and try to cover their backs and shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Still,
the disadvantage implied in occasionally feeling the want of
protection would not prevent the loss of hair, if this would
deliver the race from serious dangers from vermin; and the
force of the argument from the condition of other tropical
quadrupeds depends, at least in some measure, upon whether
or not there is something peculiar in the case of naked dogs
and men.</p>

<p>Belt argues that the naked dogs with dark, shining skins,
found in Central America and also in Peru,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and which were
found there at the Spanish conquest, have probably acquired
their peculiar condition by natural selection, because they are
despised by the natives, and no care is taken of their breeding,
and yet they do not interbreed with the common hairy
varieties, as usually happens with artificial stocks. The
advantage of a naked skin being the greater freedom it gives
from ticks, lice and other vermin, the advantage is especially
great for a domestic animal living in the huts of savages,
where, because they are inhabited year after year, vermin are
extraordinarily abundant. The naked dog, then, differs
from tropical quadrupeds which are adapted from a dateless
antiquity to such vermin as infest them, by having been
thrown by human companionship amongst not only strange
vermin, but vermin in extraordinarily dense aggregation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Belt would have guarded a weak point in his case, had he
explained why naked races of dogs are so scarce. Hairy
races may have been more recently domesticated, or bred
for their hairiness, or less addicted to an indoor life.</p>

<p>The case of our own forefather also differs somewhat from
that of other tropical mammalia; because, by hypothesis,
he underwent pretty rapidly such an extraordinary change
of life; which may have brought him into circumstances
where vermin, formerly negligible, became highly injurious.
“Monkeys,” as Belt observes, “change their sleeping-places
almost daily”; the Orang is said to construct a fresh nest
every night; this is also reported of the Gorilla. Not
improbably, then, daily change of locality was the practice
of the original anthropoid stock, whence we also are descended:
thereby avoiding the accumulation of vermin. Did the
hunting life introduce a new habit? In the old frugivorous
forest life, the custom was to get up into some tree for the
night, and within a short radius there were hundreds equally
suitable; and, therefore, there was nothing to check the
natural preference for a fresh one. When, however, the
hunting pack began to make its lair on the ground, there
was no such wide choice amongst caves, rock-shelters, or
thickets: one might be better than any other for miles
around. If, then, they settled down there as in a common
lair, the circumstances were, for the time, favourable to the
multiplication of vermin, and therefore to nakedness of skin,
in order the more easily to be rid of them. Perhaps, then,
this difference of Man from the anthropoids may be referred
to one common cause with all the others—the hunting life.
There, too, the defilement of blood made fur inconvenient
to animals not apt to cleanse themselves, like those in the
true carnivorous heredity and tradition.</p>

<p>When we consider how injurious some insects are to
vertebrate life, being suspected of having caused in some
cases the extinction of species, can it be said that facility
in ridding oneself of such vermin as lice and ticks is an inadequate
cause of human nakedness, or not one that might
outweigh the drawbacks of cold and wet? It is not, however,
incompatible with the action of sexual selection, tending to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the same result; nor, again, with the preferential destruction
of hairy children if ever infanticide was practised. A further
possible ground of deliberate selection may have been the
mere ambition of differing from other animals; for a tribe
on the Upper Amazons is reported to depilate to distinguish
themselves from the monkeys, and the wish to be superior to
other animals led a tribe in Queensland to pretend that they,
unlike kangaroos, etc., have no fathers according to the
flesh.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Admitting that this last motive can hardly have
been primitive, still, our nakedness may be a resultant of
several causes.</p>

<p>(4) Cannibalism, where it has been found amongst extant
peoples, or is known to have been formerly practised, was
often justified by certain magical or animistic ideas, but
sometimes frankly by dietetic taste, or by the satisfaction
of revenge or of emphatic triumph over an enemy. Was it
an ancient and perhaps general custom? The excavations
at Krapina in Croatia disclosed along with remains of the
Neanderthal species, which seems to have had a habitation
there, those of rhinoceros and cave-bear and of some other
kind of Man; and “some of the human bones had been
apparently split open: on that slender basis the Krapina men
have been suspected of cannibalism.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> If the suspicion is
valid, the practice existed (say) 50,000 years ago in one
species of Man; and perhaps much earlier, if we consider
how it was merely an extension of the practice of devouring
game to include the slain members of a hostile pack; for as
primitive Man, or Lycopithecus, his pre-human forebear, no
doubt regarded other animals as upon the same level as himself,
so he will have regarded human enemies as upon the
same footing with other animals. That true carnivores are
not generally cannibals may be put down to their more
ancient and perfect adaptation to a predatory life. For
them persistent cannibalism would have been too destructive,
and for us it belongs to the experimental stage of history;
though, of course, even in recent times, under stress of famine,
reversion to the practice is not unknown to civilised men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>(5) The extraordinary variability of modern Man (considered
as one species) in stature, shape of skull, size and power
of brain, colour, hairiness, quality of hair, and other characters,
physical and mental, may be referred chiefly to his
having become adapted to various local conditions upon
settling here or there for long periods of time after wandering
over the world in quest of game. The settling of offshoots
of the original stock in certain regions long enough for them
to undergo adaptation to local circumstances is the simplest
explanation of existing races: the Negro adapted to equatorial
Africa; the Asiatic stock (“Mongolian”) to Central Asia;
the Mediterranean race to the neighbourhood of the sea after
which it is named. As to the Nordic sub-race (of the Mediterranean,
we may suppose), with its fair hair and skin, it has
the appearance of an Arctic beast of prey, like the Polar bear.
The snow-leopard of the Himalaya is found at a midway
stage of such adaptation. Some geologists and zoologists
now believe that, during the Glacial Period, the climate of
Northern Europe was not everywhere such as necessarily
to destroy the local fauna and flora, and in that case our
ancestors may for ages have maintained themselves there;
or, if that was impossible (as the absence of palæolithic remains
in Scandinavia seems to indicate), they may have roamed for
many ages along the borders of glaciation, perhaps as far
as the Pacific Coast. Chinese annals refer to fair tribes in
Eastern Siberia 200 years before the Christian era;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
it seems requisite to imagine some extensive reservoir of
mankind in order to explain the origin of the vast hordes
which in prehistoric as in historical times again and again
invaded Europe—hordes</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">That the race was formerly fairer than it is now may be
inferred from the whiteness of its children’s hair: the trait
has outlived its utility. The occurrence of a fair complexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in some mountain tribes, in the Alps, <abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>, has occasioned the
conjecture that it may be due in some way to mountainous
conditions,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of which snow might be one; but, if we suppose
that the Nordic race extended during the Glacial Period into
Western Europe (having already acquired its distinctive
characters), a fair complexion in the Alps may be understood
by supposing that, whilst the greater number of them followed
the ice-sheet back to the north-east, some followed it southward
up into the mountains—if the complexion is really
ancient there.</p>

<p>Two objections to this hypothesis will occur to every one:
(i) Why are not the Esquimo fair? Because, I suppose, they
are much more recent immigrants into the Arctic regions,
and perhaps were fully clothed when they arrived there.
(ii) Could the Nordic people have existed in such circumstances
unclothed? Whether this was possible physiologists
must judge. We see the Fuegians maintain themselves,
practically naked, under very inclement conditions. And
it is not necessary to assume that the Nordic hunters were
entirely naked; since the correlation between the hair, eyes
and all parts of the skin is such that, if the whitening of any
part (say the hair) was sufficiently advantageous to determine
natural selection, the remainder of the body would be similarly
affected. And, no doubt, the Mediterranean race was
always whitish.</p>

<p>The Amerinds seem to have been derived chiefly from the
Asiatic race. Pygmies and Australians may represent
separate and still older stocks. But, as a result of migrations
and conquests, most peoples are of mixed descent; and
hence (i) individuals in the same locality sometimes vary
greatly, because they inherit the blood of different strains
in different proportions; and (ii) classification is difficult,
so that whilst some observers are content to find half a dozen
races, Deniker enumerates twenty-nine.</p>

<p>Besides general racial differences, there exist within each
race and within each national group further differences
between individuals in their physical, and still more in their
mental, stature and ability. As it was necessary that Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
should vary greatly in undergoing adaptation to the hunting
life (as well as to different local environments), he was in an
organic condition favourable to further variation.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> And this
has been utilised in his adaptation to a certain special condition
of his gregariousness, namely, life in the hunting-pack;
for this requires a difference of personality between leaders
and followers, first in the chase and later in war. A good
democrat may think it would have been a better plan to make
all men equal from the first; and I would it had been so; for
then the head of the race would not have had to drag along
such an altogether disproportionate tail: a tail so huge and
unwieldy that one may doubt whether it can ever be extricated
from the morass of barbarism. But in the early
days of gregariousness, a pack could not have held together,
or have hunted efficiently, if all had been equal and
each had exercised the right of private judgment. So in
successful packs one led and the rest followed; as they still
do, and will continue to do, of whatever kind may be the
leader. And of all structures that make up a human being
the most variable is the brain: the differences between men
in stature and physique are trifling compared with those in
mental power. Whatever feat of strength your Samson can
perform, half a dozen ordinary men can also accomplish;
but in every generation tasks are carried out by intellectual
athletes, toward which all the ordinary men in the world,
uniting their efforts, could do nothing—absolutely nothing.</p>


<h3><a id="ch01_04"></a>§ 4. Prey and Competitors</h3>

<p>If we suppose the differentiation of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hominidæ</i> from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthropoidea</i> to have begun in the Upper Oligocene, and that
the decisive change was initiated by some ape that adopted
the life of a hunter, it is interesting to consider what the world
was like in which he lived, what sort of animals surrounded
him, what animals probably became his prey, and what were
his rivals in the chase.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>The surface of the planet was less mountainous than at
present; in Europe the Pyrenees had risen, but the Alps
were only beginning to rise; and in Asia the Himalayas
began to dominate the world only in the middle of the next
epoch, the Miocene. The distribution of land and water,
too, was very different in the Oligocene from that which we
now see: Europe was divided from Asia by a broad gulf
stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Arctic Circle, and an
arm of this gulf toward the west submerged a great part of
Central Europe; Asia was broadly connected with North
America, where now the sea penetrates between Siberia and
Alaska; Africa had no connection with either Europe or
Asia; North and South America were separated—perhaps
at Panama. In the Miocene, Europe, Asia and Africa became
united. These physiographic changes may have affected
climate; for during the Eocene tropical conditions prevailed
far to the north, and coal-beds were laid down in Alaska;
but from the Oligocene onwards there was a gradual fall of
temperature, slow at first, but ending (for the present) in
the cataclysms of the Glacial Period. There was also a
decrease in some regions of atmospheric moisture, which
determines the density of vegetation. In its general character
the vegetation was similar to that which now prevails
in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world.
The species of plants now existing had not yet arrived;
but of the same genera and families as those we see, conifers,
palms and dicotyledonous flowering plants crowded the
forests and overhung the rivers. The forests were more
extensive and continuous than ours outside the tropics;
for by degrees browsing animals, feeding down the young
trees, check the renovation of forests and clear open spaces,
where grasses grow; changes of temperature limit the
northern or southern extension of certain kinds of plants,
and a failure of humidity starves all the larger kinds; converting,
at successive stages, forest into steppe and steppe
into desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Animals, especially mammalia, with which chiefly we are
concerned, were, at the close of the Oligocene, very different
from any that now roam the lands; all the species, most
genera, many families and some whole orders have since
disappeared. But there were plenty to eat and a good many
to dread. Until we know the neighbourhood in which our
ape’s adventures began, nothing precise can be said of his
circumstances. Probably it was somewhere in the Old
World, and probably it was in Asia. Unfortunately, we know
nothing of the zoological antiquities of Asia until the early
Miocene, and even then a very small selection of what must
have existed, because geologists have hitherto explored a
very small part of the continent—a few beds in north-western
and northern India and in Burmah. But there is so much
evidence of the migrations of animals in successive ages of
the Tertiary Period, that any remains from the Oligocene
and Miocene will help us to understand what sort of neighbours
our remote ancestors had to live amongst.</p>

<p>For prey there was great variety of birds and reptiles
(everywhere eaten by savages) and fishes; but we are most
concerned with the mammalia, which he may be supposed
to have pursued afoot. Of these the most important are the
hoofed animals, which fall into two great groups, perhaps
not closely connected—the odd-toed (Perissodactyls) and the
even-toed (Artiodactyls). During the Oligocene there lived
in Europe, or in North America, or in both—and, therefore,
probably in Asia—numbers of the odd-toed group: tapirs;
rhinoceroses of several species, some without horns, some
with, some amphibious (Amynodonts), all smaller than their
modern representatives; chalicotheres, strange beasts something
like horses, but instead of hoofs they had claws on their
toes—perhaps survived in China into the Pleistocene; small
predecessors of the horse with three toes on each foot; titanotheres,
hugest animals of their age, extinct in the middle of
it—something like the rhinoceros and nearly as big as an
elephant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brontotherium</i>). Of the even-toed group, pig-like
animals abounded, and some true pigs appeared; entelodonts,
or giant-pigs, were common; anthracotheres, somewhat pig-like
in size and shape; ancestral camels about the size of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sheep were to be had in North America; oreodonts, unfinished-looking
creatures of many species; primitive deer and other
ruminants, small in size and not having yet grown any horns.
In Europe, during the Upper Oligocene, cœnotheres, small and
graceful animals, lived in large herds around the lakes.
There were also primitive proboscidia about half the size
of modern elephants; many insectivores; and, amongst
rodents, beavers and tailless hares. Generally, animals of
this age that have left descendants were smaller than their
modern representatives; and notably their brains were
smaller.</p>

<p>In the Lower and Middle Miocene there appeared also
horned cervuline deer, chevrotaines, and horned antelopes;
dinotheres and mastodons, probably from Africa; primitive
hedgehogs, moles and shrews; and in the Upper Miocene,
hipparion, true hares, several varieties of hornless giraffe,
true deer, and ancestral sheep. True horses and cattle are
first known from Pliocene beds; but it is needless to follow
the story further: the fauna becomes more and more modern
in its character, and uncouth forms die out.</p>

<p>Anthropoids are first met with in the Miocene and in
Europe: pliopithecus, allied to the gibbons, in the Lower;
and dryopithecus, related to the chimpanzee, in the Middle
Miocene; but they are believed to have come from Asia.
There, in Pliocene beds of the Siwaliks (southern foot-hills of
the Himalayas), occur the orang and chimpanzee, besides
macaques, langurs and baboons. Since the orang is now
found only in Borneo and Sumatra, and the chimpanzee
only in Africa, southern Asia seems to have been the centre
from which the anthropoids dispersed; and this seems to be
the chief positive ground for believing that the human stock
began to be differentiated in that region. Since, again, by
the Middle Miocene a chimpanzee form had already migrated
into Europe, it may be assumed that the orang was already
distinct from it (and perhaps had spread eastward): the
differentiation of these genera must, therefore, have happened
earlier; and, therefore, also the differentiation of the human
stock; so that this event cannot be put later than some time
in the Oligocene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>How big was Lycopithecus to begin with? The answer
to this question must affect our view of his relations both to
prey and to enemies. Inasmuch as the three extant anthropoids
and Man are all of about the same size, there is a presumption
that their common ancestor was in stature superior to
the gibbons and to the largest monkeys—in fact, a “giant”
ape (to borrow a term from Dr. Keith). Dryopithecus “was
smaller than the chimpanzee, but much larger than the
gibbon.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Awaiting further evidence of fossils, which is
much to be desired, it is probable, on the whole, that Lycopithecus
weighed less on the average than modern man, but
more than the wolf.</p>

<p>As to competitors and aggressive enemies, there were
snakes and crocodiles; but, confining our attention to
carnivorous mammals, the time seems to have been favourable
to the enterprise of a new hunter. By the middle of the
Oligocene, the ancient Creodonts (primitive flesh-eaters which
had flourished in the Eocene) were nearly extinct, represented
in the deposits by their last surviving family, the Hyœnodonts.
Ancestors of the modern carnivores, such as may be called
by anticipation dogs and cats, derived (according to Prof.
Scott) from the Creodont Family of the Miacidæ, were becoming
numerous, but for the most part were still of small size.
Apparently, the primitive dogs and their allies must, for
some time, have been more formidable adversaries than the
primitive cats, especially if we suppose them to have already
begun to hunt in pack; and this is not improbable, both on
account of their structure and because several distinct
varieties and even genera, now extant, have that habit—such
as wolf, jackal, dingo, dhole, Cape hunting-dog, etc. In the
Upper Oligocene of North America, occurs a dog as big as a
large modern wolf, and in Europe the bear-like dog, Amphicyon,
of about the same size, but said to have been clumsy
and slow-moving. There were several other dog-like species;
they continue in the Miocene, and some of them increase in
bulk; but true modern dogs or wolves (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Canis</i>) do not appear
before the Pliocene. Then, too, first occur true bears (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ursus</i>);
hyænas in the Upper Miocene. “Cats” belong to two sub-families:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
(i) the true felines, our modern species and their
ancestors; and (ii) the machærodonts, or sabre-toothed cats.
The latter first appear in North America in the Lower Oligocene;
the former in Europe in the Middle Oligocene. The
sabre-tooths are so called from their thin, curved upper
canines; which were so long (3 to 6 inches) that it is not
easy to understand how they could open their mouths wide
enough to bite with them. That they were effective in some
way is proved by the fact that machærodonts, first appearing
in the Lower Oligocene, increased in numbers and diversity
of species for ages, and some of them in bulk. In North
America, in the Upper Oligocene, one species was as large as
a jaguar, and some of the biggest and most terrifying were
contemporary with Man, and only became extinct in the
Pleistocene. Their limbs were relatively shorter and thicker
than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Felinæ</i>. These, the true cats, at first
progressed more slowly than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Machærodontidæ</i>; but in the
Siwalik deposits (Pliocene) there occur, along with machærodonts,
forms resembling the leopard and the lynx, with
others as large as tigers. The largest of all this group seems
to have been the cave-lion, perhaps a large variety of the
common African lion, which also lived with Man in Europe
in the Pleistocene. These were serious competitors in the
hunting-life of Lycopithecus and of primitive Man; and the
effect of such competition in exterminating inferior forms is
shown by the fate of the carnivorous marsupials of South
America (allied to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thylacinus</i>), which were the predatory
fauna of that region, until in the Pliocene, North and South
America having become united by continuous land, cats and
dogs came in from the northern continent and put an end
to them; and also by the fate of the creodonts, which in the
Oligocene seem everywhere to have been exterminated by
the new carnivores. In both cases the beaten competitors
were very inferior in the size and complexity of their brains;
and if Man has succeeded in the struggle for life against the
same foes, in spite of his inferior bodily adaptation, it is
probably due to his very superior brains. This may also be
the reason why modern Man (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens!</i>), wandering
everywhere over the world, has everywhere exterminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
such experiments in human nature as Pithecanthropus,
Eoanthropus, and Neanderthalensis; as others are soon to
follow them into the Hades of extinct species.</p>

<p>These few pages give a ridiculously faint sketch of the
animal world amidst which our remote ancestors began their
career. But it may serve to indicate that there was always
plenty to eat if you could kill it, and plenty of rivals who
wanted their share. After the disappearance of the dinosaurs
at the close of the Cretaceous period, the mammalia, already
numerous, developed rapidly, and spread in ever multiplying
numbers and diverging shapes over the whole area of the
land. We may take it that from the Middle Eocene (at least)
onwards the earth has always been as full of wild beasts as it
would hold. To understand what it was like in the Middle
Oligocene, one should read the adventures of hunters in South
Africa seventy or eighty years ago (their verisimilitude is
vouched for by Livingstone),<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> before a gun in the hands of
every Kaffir had begun to thin the vast herds that then
covered the whole landscape, and in whose numbers the wild
hunters and the lions could make no appreciable diminution.
The little Bushmen regarded themselves and the lions as
joint owners and masters of all the game. The masters
fought one another, indeed; but there was no necessity to
fight, for there was more than enough for both: lions were
then sometimes met in gangs of ten or a dozen. Game
throughout the Cainozoic ages was abundant and of all
sizes: many small, many middle-sized and some prodigious.
Even in the Eocene, some of the Amblypoda (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dinoceras</i>, Am.)
and of the Barypoda (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arsinotherium</i>, Af.) were as big as
rhinoceroses; in the Oligocene, Titanotheres not much smaller
than elephants; in South America, in Miocene and Pliocene
times, the Toxodonts; in the Pleistocene, Ground-sloths of
huge bulk, and Glyptodonts. Of Families still represented
amongst living animals, dinotheres and mastodons occur in
the Miocene; and elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
giraffe have abounded from the Pliocene to recent times,
in many species, over most of Africa and the northern hemisphere.
Even the marsupials in Australia produced a species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diprotodon</i>) as large as a rhinoceros with a skull three feet long.
Any one of these would have been a meal for a whole pack of
hunters, if they could kill it—as we may be sure they could.</p>


<h3><a id="ch01_05"></a>§ 5. Conclusion</h3>

<p>From the addiction of some ancestral ape to animal food,
and to the life of a hunter in order to obtain it, then, the
special characteristics of Man seem to be natural consequences.
The hypothesis from which everything follows is exceptionally
simple and moderate. It is generally admitted that our
ancestor was a large anthropoid—possibly more gregarious
than others, possibly more apt to live upon the ground;
but neither of these suppositions is requisite. He was
adapted to his life, as the chimpanzee and gorilla are to
theirs: in which, probably, they have gone on with little
change for ages. But into his life a disturbing factor entered—the
impulse to attack, hunt and eat animals, which extensively
replaced his former peaceable, frugivorous habit. The cause
of this change may have been a failure in the supply of his
usual diet, or an “accidental variation” of appetite. Not
a great number need have shared in the hunting impulse; it
is enough that a few should have felt it, or even one. If
advantageous and inheritable, it would spread through his
descendants. It was advantageous (<i>a</i>) in enlarging their
resources of nutrition, and (<i>b</i>) in enabling them to escape
from the tropical forest. On the other hand, to those least
fit for the new life it brought the disadvantages of more
strenuous exertion and of competition with other carnivorous
types. But with hands and superior intelligence, those that
had the requisite character succeeded. There was rapid
selection of those whose variations of structure, character,
activity were most effective in dealing with game and with
enemies; especially of those who combined and co-operated,
and learned to direct co-operation by some rudimentary speech.</p>

<p>But, again, the hunting impulse here assumed to have
possessed some anthropoid was not something entirely new;
anthropoids and many other Primates are known to seize
and devour birds, lizards and even small mammals when
chance offers an easy opportunity. It is merely a greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
persistence in this behaviour that turns it into hunting.
How very improbable that such a change should <em>not</em> sometimes
occur! Is it not likely to have occurred often, and with
many failures? Similarly, of the resulting changes: the
differentiation of our hands and feet is only an advance
upon what you see in the gorilla; as for our ground-life, can
the adult male gorilla be fairly called arboreal? Several
Primates use unwrought weapons; most of them lead a
gregarious life, to which our own is a return; they are co-operative
at least in defence; like many other animals, they
communicate by gestures and inarticulate vocal cries. Co-operative
hunting, indeed, seems to be new in our Order;
but since wolves and dogs, or their ancestors, fell in with it
some time or other, why should it be beyond the capacity
of apes? On second thoughts, is the co-operative raiding
of plantations by baboons something altogether different
from hunting in pack? Thus at each occasion of change in
structure or function, Lycopithecus merely carried some
tendency of the other Primates a little further, and a little
further; until, certainly, he went a long way. The whole
movement can be distinctly pictured throughout, and it has
an air of being natural or even inevitable. Few hypotheses
ask us to grant less than this one.</p>

<p>Moreover, if the story is not true, Man is an exception
to the rule of animal life, that the structure of every organism
is made up of apparatus subserving its peculiar conditions
of nutrition and reproduction. Indeed, conditions of nutrition
are the ground of the differentiation of animals and plants.
Conditions of reproduction need not here be considered, as
the apparatus is the same in the anthropoids and in ourselves.
With many species to avoid being eaten and to mate
are the reasons for some secondary characters, such as protective
armour or coloration, fleetness with its correlative
structures, nuptial plumage, and so forth. But to avoid
being eaten and to mate, it is first of all necessary to eat and
live; and accordingly, for each sort of animal, starting from
the organisation of some earlier stock, its structure and
activities are determined by the kind of food it gets, and the
conditions of getting it: in our case, the hunting of game afoot.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<br />ON THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE HUMAN FROM
THE ANTHROPOID MIND</h2>


<h3><a id="ch02_01"></a>§ 1. Heredity, Adaptation, Accommodation</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Following</span> the general belief that Man is descended from
a stock nearly allied to the greater anthropoids—Orang,
Chimpanzee, Gorilla—we may assume that his mental endowments
were once much the same as theirs; and that, so far
as they are still the same, <em>heredity</em> sufficiently explains his
having them. Thus the senses, perception, the simpler
forms of comparison and inference, the appetites and many
of the instincts and emotions are common to us with the
apes, are seen in our children under three years old, and (in
short) constitute that generic consciousness (as I have called
it) from which the human mind in general and the peculiar
traits of races and individuals are differentiated.</p>

<p>So much for heredity; but the differences of the human
from the anthropoid mind, alike in intelligence and in character,
are enormous, and must be accounted for in some
other way. Allowing for some original specific difference
which we can hardly hope to discover, the changes that have
taken place may be considered as the result of <em>adaptation</em>
to those habits of life under which our species (now ranking
zoologically as a Family) has been developed. And this
adaptation I shall assume to have been brought about under
conditions of natural selection: human races, as we now see
them, being the survivors of many variations, more or less
successful, and the others having been destroyed. For
good judges are of opinion that, amongst the discovered
remains of ancient specimens of the human family, some
that exhibit marked deviations from the modern type—Neanderthalensis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Eoanthropus, Pithecanthropus—should be
regarded not as belonging to our ancestral line, but rather
as representing distinct species that have failed in the struggle
for existence.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>But besides the innate dispositions of human nature
determined by heredity and natural selection, which are found
in some measure universally, because they are adaptations
to conditions that, at one time and not long ago, weighed
upon the ancestors of all of us, there are numerous traits
(some of them quite superficial) that vary from country
to country and from age to age, according to the economic
or political type of the society in which a man lives, his
place therein, geographical circumstances, religious institutions
and the countless causes that govern manners and
customs. In the lives of most men these traits are not
necessary; they may be adopted and cast aside more than
once in an individual’s career: they are temporary <em>accommodations</em>
due to education, imitation, tradition; and, in fact,
are often the disguises of human nature. Still, as society
grows more and more complex, orderly and stable, there is,
no doubt, again some natural selection of those individuals
who are capable of undergoing the requisite accommodations.
Those that cannot endure the restraints of civilisation, wander
away; the extremely lazy, improvident, dishonest, or aggressive,
in considerable numbers, perish.</p>


<h3><a id="ch02_02"></a>§ 2. The Original Stock and the Conditions
of Differentiation</h3>

<p>To the original mentality of man we can only seek a clue
in the higher Primates, and especially in the extant anthropoids.
No doubt, during the long millennia that have
elapsed since the separation of our own stock from those
of other genera and species, they also have undergone some
evolution, but probably much less change than we have.
Unfortunately, our knowledge of their habits and abilities is
still deplorably limited. It seems certain, however, that
their intelligence is much greater than that of any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
kind of animal. They must have extensive knowledge of
their habitat, of all the forest can yield for food or shelter,
and of its other denizens dangerous or otherwise. They
construct for themselves some sort of sleeping-place, not
much inferior to the Australians’ “lean-to,” by piling branches
together in the trees. Toward men, anthropoids seem to be
unaggressive, and usually retreat from them; but, when
attacked, defend themselves with fury. From other animals
the male gorilla has nothing to fear, and he defends his family
against leopards; the chimpanzee is said to fight leopards
with varying success; and, as for the orang, Dyak chiefs told
Wallace that no animals dare attack him, except crocodiles
and pythons, and that he kills both of them.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The food
of these apes is chiefly fruit and the tender shoots of trees
and bamboos; but they sometimes eat eggs and young
birds; and the gorilla is said to eat small mammals: in
confinement they all take cooked flesh freely. Socially, they
hardly get beyond family life. Orangs male and female
are even seen alone, and young ones together without parents;
gorillas are seen in family parties; chimpanzees in families,
and occasionally three or four families in company. It is
said that gorillas and chimpanzees have been seen together
in a large band. I have met with no report of these animals
fighting amongst themselves, except that male gorillas sometimes
fight for a wife. Gorillas have also been said, upon
very slight evidence, to be polygamous; chimpanzees and
orangs seem to be monogamous.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Their family life is probably,
as amongst all the other Primates, affectionate: the
long youth of their children implies much parental care.
Whilst the smaller anthropoids—siamang and gibbon—go in
troops, as also do the baboons and most monkeys of both
hemispheres, the less sociability of the great anthropoids
may be understood to result (<i>a</i>) from the limited supply of
the right sort of food for them, even in the tropical forest
to which they are confined—since animals of their bulk must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
consume a great deal; and (<i>b</i>) from their having no need
of combining for the purpose of defence.</p>

<p>From the type thus outlined the mentality of the human
race has departed so widely that some even of those who
believe that our bodies have been derived from some simian
stock (<abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr> Wallace) hesitate to admit that our minds can
have had a similar history. But as everywhere else in the
animal kingdom mind and body constitute one organism,
it is reasonable to consider whether the differentiation
of the mind of man may not be understood to have
taken place under the same conditions as those which
determined the transformation of his body. What were these
conditions?</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the foregoing chapter I have collected a number of
facts and arguments pointing to the probability that the
chief cause of the evolution of the human Family was the
adoption by some anthropoid (or allied form) of the life of
the hunter in order to obtain animal food. That the change
from a frugivorous to a carnivorous diet may itself have
had some effect upon our temperament and activity is
possible; but I lay no stress upon that. Most monkeys are
almost exclusively frugivorous; the only Primate, except
man, that depends a good deal upon animal food is, I believe,
the crab-eating macaque (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macacus cynomolgus</i>), of the
Burmese and Malay littoral; yet monkeys are the most
alert and active of animals; some of them are amongst the
most courageous; anthropoids are amongst the most powerful.
A carnivorous diet alone would not explain any changes
in the shape and proportions of our trunk and limbs, nor
the upright gait, nor the gregarious habit, nor the development
of the brain, nor the invention of weapons, nor the
use of fire, nor any of the mental and emotional characteristics
that distinguish man from the other Primates; but all these
things readily follow from our remote ancestor’s adoption
of the life of the hunter.</p>

<p>Sociologists, surveying extant peoples, have usually distinguished
four stages of culture, the hunting, pastoral,
agricultural and manufacturing; and some have indicated
what they suppose to have been a still earlier stage, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
“collecting,” such as may be seen, <abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>, amongst the Fuegians.
But the collecting state is plainly degenerate, the resource of
tribes fallen into distress; it cannot have been the first stage,
because it implies no conditions that tend in any way to
develop body or mind or society. That hunting came first
is a true intuition: and, to understand the development of
human nature, we need only refer the hunting-life back to
the very origin of the human stock.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The great anthropoids are all confined to the equatorial
forests; and it is obvious that, with their diet, it is impossible
to pass out of tropical or (at furthest) sub-tropical regions.
But the adoption of a flesh diet enabled the human stock to
extend the range of its hunting (allowing for gradual adaptation
to climate or accommodation by clothing) to any country
that supplied the requisite prey; and, accordingly, in course
of time, it wandered to every part of the world. The settling
of various off-shoots of the original stock in certain regions
long enough for them to undergo adaptation to local conditions
is (as we have seen) the simplest explanation of
existing races.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Whilst none of the great anthropoids has advanced
socially beyond family life, man is everywhere (with few
and doubtful exceptions) gregarious—living at the lowest
grade in tribes or bands of about fifty; and the gregarious
life is one of the most important conditions of his peculiar
development. Possibly, he may originally have been more
gregarious than any extant anthropoid, in spite of his not
needing society for defence, and of its seeming to be for
so large a frugivorous animal inconvenient in relation to
nutrition. Moreover, if the great anthropoids and our own
ancestors were descended from some stock of the lower
monkeys, such as always go in troops, the gregarious instinct
may have remained with them as a latent character. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
it is my conjecture that man became gregarious, or recovered
the social habit, because of the utility of co-operative hunting;
so that he became at first a sort of wolf-ape. This will
be discussed in the next section. I observe here, however,
that the hypothesis helps us to understand why man is still
imperfectly sociable; the purpose of the hunting-pack, each
wolf-ape seeking prey, was unfavourable to social life in
other relations. That in human life group-consciousness
preceded self-consciousness is a groundless and fantastic
notion: all known savages are fully self-conscious, as their
sentiments and behaviour imply; and even the higher
brutes are (in my judgment) self-conscious in their relations
with others. Current speculations about fashion, imitation,
tradition, crowd-psychology, are in danger of exaggeration,
and overlook the patent facts of individualism, as shown by
the hypocrite, the criminal, the vagrant, the contra-suggestible,
the hermit, the sceptic, the saint. Some people—without
being in any way morbid—find that a good deal of
solitude is necessary to the complete life: by nature the
student and the pioneer escape from the crowd.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The later stages of human development have been
considerably modified by certain imaginary conditions
peculiar to Man; for he—we know not at what date—invented
them. These may be summed up under the names
of Magic and Animism; and in subsequent chapters they
will be discussed, with their astonishing vagaries and still
more astonishing reactions upon human life.</p>

<p>The chief conditions, then, to which man has been adapted,
and thereby differentiated in body and mind from the anthropoid
stock, I take to be four: the hunting life; geographical
circumstances; social life; and his own imaginations.</p>


<h3><a id="ch02_03"></a>§ 3. Primal Society</h3>

<p>In looking for the probable form of the earliest human or
(rather) prehuman society, one naturally makes a survey of
other mammalian societies; and the task is soon accomplished.
It is surprising how few and simple the types of
them are, in contrast with the elaborate polities of some
hymenoptera and of the termites: these have much greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
superficial resemblance to modern human societies; but, in
fact, they are families rather than societies; their interesting
activities will one day probably be traced to relatively simple
mechanisms; and in every way they are too remote from us
for any useful comparison. As for mammalian societies,
even using the term to include families, they may be classified
under four or five types:</p>

<p>(1) Families: (<i>a</i>) Monogamous: of which the best examples
seem to be found in some monkeys. Many of the cats are
believed to pair monogamously; but it is doubtful whether,
or in what measure, the male takes part in the rearing of the
whelps.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Polygamous: characteristic of many species of deer;—after
the breeding-season, the stags often wander away by
themselves.</p>

<p>(2) Associations of families without apparent structure or
organisation, such as those of the vizcacha and the beaver.
They have no leaders, and make no attempt at mutual defence;
but their inco-ordinated activities, in making their burrows,
dams, etc., have results which, especially in the case of the
beavers, look as if the animals had worked upon a common,
premeditated plan. Gregariousness exists widely in the
animal kingdom without any utility in attack or defence,
but merely for convenience of breeding, or for the advantage
of signalling the approach of danger, from any direction, to
the whole flock.</p>

<p>(3) Troops or herds, comprising several families. This
type is common amongst monkeys: generally the families
are monogamous, and both parents care for the offspring;
they have leaders, and combine in mutual defence. This
is especially effective with the baboons—who, however, are
polygamous. A very similar type is characteristic of cattle;
who also have leaders as the result of battle between the
bulls, each trying to control and keep together as many
cows as he can; and they often combine their forces against
beasts of prey.</p>

<p>(4) Hunting-packs—most noticeable with wolves and wild
dogs: they have leaders, and probably an order of precedence
determined by battle. In the breeding-season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
(February to August) a pack of wolves breaks up into pairs;
but whether their pairing is for life or merely seasonal is
disputed; and it is also doubtful whether the male takes
any share in caring for the puppies; such habits may vary
in different localities.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The numbers of the pack depend
on circumstances, and are now much smaller in Canada
than in Russia.</p>

<p>Was our own primitive society, then, like any of these?
Since direct evidence cannot be obtained, we must be guided
in forming our hypothesis by two considerations: (<i>a</i>) what
type of society gives the best explanation of human nature
as we now find it? and (<i>b</i>) for which type can we give the
best reason why it should have been adopted? So I point
out (<i>a</i>) that man, in character, is more like a wolf or dog
than he is like any other animal; and (<i>b</i>) that for the forming
of a pack there was a clear ground in the advantage to be
obtained by co-operative hunting.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>It must be admitted that Darwin, discussing sexual selection
in man, suggests a different hypothesis. He says:
“Looking far enough back in the stream of time, and judging
from the social habits of man as he now exists, the most
probable view is that he aboriginally lived in small communities,
each with a single wife, or if powerful with several,
whom he jealously guarded against all other men. Or he
may not have been a social animal, and yet have lived with
several wives, like the gorilla; for all the natives ‘agree
that but one adult male is seen in a band; when the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
male grows up, a contest takes place for mastery, and the
strongest, by killing and driving out the others, establishes
himself as the head of the community.’ The younger males,
being thus expelled and wandering about, would, when at
last successful in finding a partner, prevent too close inter-breeding
within the limits of the same family.”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The
information concerning the polygamy of the gorilla, quoted
here from Dr. Savage, who wrote in 1845, has not since
(I believe) been confirmed, except by Prof. Garner.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Naturally, the above passage has attracted the attention
of anthropologists; and I am sorry to expose myself to the
charge of immodesty in venturing to put forward a different
view. Atkinson in his essay on <cite>Primal Law</cite>, edited with
qualified approval by Andrew Lang, starts from Darwin’s
hypothesis, and merely modifies it by urging that the young
males, when driven off by their father, did not wander away,
but kept near the family, always on the watch to murder
their father. This amendment he makes, because he had
observed the same habits in cattle and horses. Then, through
a row of hypotheses with little evidence or rational connection,
he arrives at an explanation of certain savage laws
of avoidance, exogamy, etc. More recently, Prof. Freud
has produced a most ingenious and entertaining essay on
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Totem und Tabu</cite>, in which he builds upon the same foundations.
You easily see how the “Œdipus complex” emerges
from such a primitive state of things, but will hardly, without
reading the work, imagine the wealth of speculation it
contains or its literary attractiveness. Atkinson probably
relied upon the supposed parallel case of wild cattle and
horses, because those animals resemble the apes in being
vegetarian: though the diets are, in fact, very different.
But even if such a comparison indicates a possible social
state of our original ape-like stock, what is there in such a
state that can be supposed to have introduced the changes
that made our forebears no longer ape-like? Supposing those
changes to have already taken place, what evidence is there
that the same social state endured? None: for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
assumed to have been the social state of our forebears on
the ground of their resemblance in diet and family economy
to the gorilla.</p>

<p>Returning, then, to our hypothesis as to the chief cause of
human differentiation, namely, that a certain Primate, more
nearly allied to the anthropoids than to any other, became
carnivorous and adopted the life of a hunter, there are (as
I have said) two ways in which this may have happened:
either by such a variation on the part of our ancestor that
he felt a stronger appetite for animal food than the gorilla
does—strong enough to make him hunt for prey; or by
such a change of climate in the region he inhabited—say
from sub-tropical to temperate—as to make his former diet
scarce, especially in winter, so that he became a hunter to
avoid starvation. Every one admits that he became a
hunter at some time: why not at the earliest? Nothing
less than some great change of life, concentrating all his
powers and straining every faculty, can possibly account
for the enormous differentiation of Man. The adoption of
the hunting life is such a change; and the further back
we put it, the better it explains the other changes that have
occurred in our physical and mental nature.</p>

<p>From the outset, again, our ancestor may have attacked
big game, probably Ungulates—to whom he owed much;
for not only did they provide prey, but by clearing the
forest over wide areas compelled him to run in pursuit remote
from his native trees, thus giving great selective advantage
to every variation of legs and feet adapted to running: though
at the very first there may have been little need to run, as
he was not yet an object of terror; “we must remember
that if man was unskilful, animals were unsuspicious.”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> I
suppose him, at first, to have fallen to with hands and teeth:
combining with others in a hungry, savage onslaught. By
attacking big game advantage was given to those individuals
and families who co-operated in hunting: thus forming the
primal society of the human stock; a society entirely different
from that of any of the Primates, or of cattle, and most like
that of the dogs and wolves—a hunting-pack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>As in the course of generations the hunting-pack developed,
no doubt, it had recognised leaders, the most powerful males,
one perhaps pre-eminent. But it was not subject to one
old male who claimed all the females; for the more adult
males it comprised, the stronger it was; and, for the same
reason, pairing, as among wolves, was the most efficient
form of sexual relationship. But, in my judgment, it is
altogether vain to try to deduce from this form of society,
which may have existed three or four million years ago,
any of the known customs of savages concerning marriage,
such as avoidance, totemism, exogamy; which would be of
comparatively recent date if we put back their origin 500,000
years. Many such rules can only have arisen when there
was already a tradition and a language capable of expressing
relationships.</p>


<h3><a id="ch02_04"></a>§ 4. Psychology of the Hunting-pack</h3>

<p>Possibly our ape-like ancestor was more sociable than
any of the anthropoids; but sociability in ape-life would
in no way account for our present character as men: nothing
accounts for it, except the early formation of the hunting-pack.
Since, however, we can know nothing of that institution
directly, we must try to learn something about it from
the parallel case of dogs and wolves. Galton remarks how
readily the proceedings of man and dog “are intelligible
to one another. Every whine or bark of the dog, each of
his fawning, savage, or timorous movements is the exact
counterpart of what would have been the man’s behaviour,
had he felt similar emotions. As the man understands the
thoughts of the dog, so the dog understands the thoughts of
the man, by attending to his natural voice, his countenance,
and his actions.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> No more, if as much, could be said of
the terms upon which we stand with a tame chimpanzee,
in spite of greater physical and facial resemblance and nearer
kinship. What can connect us so closely in mind with an
animal so remote from us in lineage and anatomy as the dog
is? Adaptation to the same social conditions, the life of
the hunting-pack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>(1) The master-interest of every member of the pack lies
in the chase, because success in it is necessary to life. To
show how this passion actuates ourselves, I quote Mr. F.&nbsp;C.
Selous; who, during an expedition in Canada, roused a caribou
stag within twenty yards, saw “the dreadful terror” in his
eyes, and shot him. “Did I feel sorry for what I had done?
it may be asked. Well! no, I did not. Ten thousand
years of superficial and unsatisfying civilisation have not
altered the fundamental nature of man, and the successful
hunter of to-day becomes a primeval savage, remorseless,
triumphant, full of a wild, exultant joy, which none but
those who have lived in the wilderness, and depended on
their success as hunters for their daily food, can ever know
or comprehend.”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> To the hunter my paradox must seem
a truism. And that the hunter temporarily released from
civilised restraints, who suffers such intoxication, merely
renews old savage raptures is shown by the following curious
parallel: a Bushman, returning from a successful hunt to
the wagons of the traveller Baines—“Behold me!” he
shouted, “the hunter! Yea, look on me, the killer of
elephants and mighty bulls! Behold me, the big elephant,
the lion! Look on me, ye Damaras and Makalaka; admire
and confess that I am a great Bull-calf.”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Again, since the interest of the chase culminates in the
kill—for this is the condition of making a meal—to kill
becomes, in some predatory animals, a passion that is often
gratified without regard to their needs. Wolves often slay
many more sheep than they devour: a sheep-dog that undergoes
reversion kills by night the sheep on neighbouring farms
without any call of hunger; and, says Mr. Thompson Seton
(writing of the natives of North Canada), “the mania for
killing that is seen in so many white men, is evidently a
relic of savagery; for all these Indians and half-breeds
are full of it.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> They fired at everything they saw. The
manners of my own pack—now long dispersed—were very
similar to the Indians’; and the sport of pigeon- or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
pheasant-shooting has been reduced to its last element—skilful
slaying.</p>

<p>The disposition to slay is reinforced, when prey makes
serious resistance, by anger; and generally by a distinct
tendency, sometimes called “destructiveness,” perhaps a
latent character derived from the monkeys, and which I
take to be partly a play-impulse and partly an expression of
curiosity.</p>

<p>(2) The gregariousness of the pack is variable; probably,
amongst wolves, it was much greater anciently than it is
to-day. There are conflicting statements about the gregariousness
of wolves that have been studied in different countries.
Couteulx de Canteleu (France) says: “The wolf is an enemy
of all society; when they assemble it is not a pacific society,
but a band of brigands.”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Thompson Seton (Canada) says:
“Wolves are the most sociable of beasts of prey; they
arrange to render one another assistance. A pack seems to
be an association of personal acquaintances, and would
resent the presence of a total stranger.”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Gregariousness of
wolves must be reduced by failure of game (as by the destruction
of bison in North America), and still more by the encroachments
of civilisation (as in France). The primitive human
pack, probably, was more constantly gregarious than wolves
are: (<i>a</i>) because its individuals, having no instinctive or
traditionary knowledge of hunting, were more dependent on
co-operation; and (<i>b</i>) because the long youth of children
made it necessary for parents to associate with the pack
during their nurture—else no pack could have existed; for
whilst wolves are nearly full-grown at eighteen months, apes
are not mature until the eighth or ninth year. At a later
period, after the invention of effective weapons, an individual
became, for many kinds of game, less dependent on co-operation;
but by that time, the hunting-grounds of a pack
were circumscribed by those of other hostile packs; so that
no one dared go far alone.</p>

<p>(3) With gregariousness went, of course, (<i>a</i>) perceptive
sympathy—every animal read instantly in the behaviour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
others their feelings and impulses; (<i>b</i>) contagious sympathy—the
impulses of any animal, expressed in its behaviour, spread
rapidly to all the rest; and (<i>c</i>) effective sympathy, so far (at
least) as that all united to defend any associate against
aggression from outside the pack. Perceptive and contagious
sympathy, however, extend beyond the limits of
the pack or the species. Most of the higher mammalia can
read the state of mind of others, though of widely different
kinds, in their expression and behaviour; and many are liable
to have their actions immediately affected by signs of the
emotional impulses of others, especially fear. These modes
of sympathy, therefore, though liveliest amongst gregarious
animals, are not dependent on specific gregariousness.</p>

<p>(4) The pack has a disposition to aggression upon every
sort of animal outside the pack, either as prey or as a competitor
for prey: limited no doubt by what we should call
considerations of prudence or utility; which must vary with
the size of the pack, the prowess of its individuals, the
possession of weapons, etc. After the invention of weapons
and snares, many savage tribes can kill every sort of animal
in their habitat, as the palæolithic Europeans did many
thousands of years ago. From the outset the human pack
must have come into competition with the true carnivores,
must have defended itself against them, may have discovered
that attack was the safest defence, and may have been
victorious even without weapons. Mr. G.&nbsp;P. Sanderson
writes: “It is universally believed by the natives (of South
India) that the tiger is occasionally killed by packs of wild
dogs.... From what I have seen of their style of hunting,
and of their power of tearing and lacerating, I think there
can be no doubt of their ability to kill a tiger.... Causes
of hostility may occasionally arise between the tiger and wild
dogs through attempted interference with each other’s
prey.”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>(5) A hunting-pack, probably, always claims a certain
territory. This is the first ground of the sense of property,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
so strongly shown by domestic dogs: the territorial claims
of the half-wild dogs of Constantinople are well known. To
nourish a pack the hunting-grounds must be extensive. Mr.
Thompson Seton says that in Canada the wolf has a permanent
home-district and a range of about fifty miles.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Very many
generations must have elapsed before the deviation of our
forebears from anthropoid habits resulted in the formation
of so many packs as to necessitate the practical delimitation
of hunting-grounds. Then the aggressiveness of the pack
turned upon strangers of its own species; the first wars
arose, and perhaps cannibalism on the part of the victors.
It is certain that, in North America, wolves kill and eat
foxes, dogs, coyotes; and it is generally believed that wolves
will eat a disabled companion; though, according to Mr.
W.&nbsp;H. Hudson, a wolf will only eat another when it has
killed that other, and then only as the carrying out of the
instinct to eat whatever it has killed.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It may be so.</p>

<p>(6) A pack must have a leader, and must devotedly follow
him as long as he is manifestly the best of the pack; and
here we have a rudimentary loyalty.</p>

<p>(7) Every individual must be subservient to the pack,
as long as it works together; and this seems to be the ground
of the “instinct of self-abasement” (McDougall), so far as
the attitudes involved in such subserviency are due to a
distinct emotional impulse, and are not rather expressive of
fear or of devotion.</p>

<p>(8) The members of the pack must be full of emulation;
in order that, when the present leader fails, others may be
ready to take his place.</p>

<p>(9) For the internal cohesion of the pack, there must be
the equivalent of a recognised table of precedence amongst
its members; and this is reconciled with the spirit of emulation,
by fighting until each knows his place, followed by
complete submission on the part of the inferior. Mr. Th.
Roosevelt says of a pack of dogs employed in bear-hunting,
“at feeding-time each took whatever his strength permitted,
and each paid abject deference to whichever animal was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
known superior in prowess.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Hudson writes
of dogs on cattle-breeding establishments on the pampas,
that he presumes “they are very much like feral dogs and
wolves in their habits. Their quarrels are incessant; but
when a fight begins the head of the pack, as a rule, rushes
to the spot,” and tries to part the combatants—not always
successfully. “But from the foremost in strength and power
down to the weakest there is a gradation of authority; each
one knows just how far he can go, which companion he can
bully when in a bad temper or wishing to assert himself,
and to which he must humbly yield in his turn.”<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The
situation reminds one of a houseful of schoolboys, and of
how ontogeny repeats phylogeny. Where political control
is very feeble, as in mining camps or backwoods settlements,
civilised men revert to the same conditions. Fifty years
ago, “all along the frontier between Canada and the United
States, every one knew whom he could lick, and who could
lick him.”<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Amongst Australian aborigines, we are told
that “precedence counts for very much.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>(10) A pack of wolves relies not merely upon running down
its prey, but resorts to various stratagems to secure it: as
by surrounding it; heading it off from cover; driving it over
a precipice; arranging relays of pursuers, who take up the
chase when the first begin to flag; setting some to lie in
ambush while the rest drive the prey in their direction.
Such devices imply intelligent co-operation, some means of
communicating ideas, patience and self-control in the interests
of the pack and perseverance in carrying out a plan. Failure
to co-operate effectually is said to be punished with death.
Primitive man, beginning with more brains than a wolf,
may be supposed soon to have discovered such arts and to
have improved upon them.</p>

<p>(11) When prey has been killed by a pack of wolves, there
follows a greedy struggle over the carcass, each trying to
get as big a meal as possible. Mr. Th. Roosevelt writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of dogs used in hunting the cougar (puma): “The relations
of the pack amongst themselves (when feeding) were those
of wild beast selfishness.... They would all unite in the
chase and the fierce struggle which usually closed it. But
the instant the quarry was killed, each dog resumed his
normal attitude of greedy anger or greedy fear toward the
others.”<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> As this was a scratch pack of hounds, however,
we cannot perhaps infer that a naturally formed pack of
wolves is equally discordant, or that the human pack was
ever normally like that. Galton, indeed, says: “Many
savages are so unamiable and morose as to have hardly any
object in associating together, besides that of mutual support;”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
but this is by no means true of all savages. At
any rate, the steadier supply of food obtained by our race
since the adoption of pastoral or agricultural economy, with
other circumstances, has greatly modified the greedy and
morose attitude in many men and disguised it in others;
though it reappears under conditions of extreme social
dislocation, and it is a proverb that “thieves quarrel over
their plunder.” In the original pack such a struggle over
the prey may have subserved the important utility of eliminating
the weak, and of raising the average strength and
ferocity. But some custom must have been established for
feeding the women and children. No doubt when fruits
were obtainable, the women and children largely subsisted
upon them. But the strong instinct of parental care in
Primates, the long youth of children, and the greater relative
inferiority of females to males (common to anthropoids and
savages) than is found amongst dogs and wolves, must have
made the human pack from the first differ in many ways
from a pack of wolves.</p>

<p>So much, then, as to the traits of character established in
primitive man by his having resorted to co-operative hunting:
they all plainly persist in ourselves.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>On our intelligence life in the hunting-pack had just as
revolutionary an influence, as already explained in the first
chapter. The whole art of hunting had to be learned from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
its rudiments by this enterprising family. With them there
was no inherited instinct or disposition, and no tradition or
instruction, as there is with the true carnivores: they
depended solely on observation, memory, inference. With
poor olfactory sense (as usual in apes) prey must be followed
and inconvenient enemies outwitted, by acquiring a knowledge
of their footprints and other visible signs of neighbourhood,
and by discrimination of all the noises they make.
The habits and manners of prey and of enemies, their favourite
lairs, feeding-grounds and watering-places, their paths through
forest, marsh, thicket and high grass, must all be learnt:
so must their speed, endurance, means and methods of
attack and defence. The whole country within the range
of the pack must be known, its resources and its difficulties;
and whenever new territory was entered, new lessons in all
these matters had to be learned. This must have entailed
a rapid natural selection of brains. Only a rapidly developing,
plastic brain could have been capable of the requisite
accommodation of behaviour in such conditions: a mechanism
was required by which more and more new lines of specialised
reaction were related to numerous newly observed and
discriminated facts.</p>

<p>The very crudest weapons may be handled with variable
dexterity; the best handling must be discovered and practised;
and this had a high selective value for the hands as
well as for the brain. Probably crude weapons were very
early used; for some monkeys (and baboons generally) throw
sticks or stones, or roll stones down upon an enemy. In
Borneo, Wallace came upon a female orang who, “as soon
as she saw us, began breaking off branches and the great
spiny fruits [of the durian] with every appearance of rage,
causing such a shower of missiles as effectually kept us from
approaching too near the tree. This habit of throwing down
branches has been doubted; but I have, as here narrated,
observed it myself on three separate occasions.”<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The
importance of the observation consists in its proving the
existence in an anthropoid of the impulse to use missiles
under the occasional stress of anger; so that it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
expected rapidly to develop under the constant pressure of
hunger. The use of clubs and stones induced the discrimination
of the best materials for such weapons, and where they
could be found; and, in process of time, brought in a rough
shaping of them, the better to serve their purposes. Then
came the invention of snares and pitfalls and the discovery
of poisons.</p>

<p>Thus the primitive human, or prehuman mind, was active
in many new directions; and depending for its skill, not
upon instinct or imitation, but upon observation and memory
and inference, it was necessary for it to arrange ideas in a
definite order before acting upon them, as in making weapons
or planning a hunt; indefiniteness or confusion in such
matters was fatal. The contrast between growing memory
of the past and present experience, between practical ideas
and the actions realising them that had been suspended until
the right moment came, furthered the differentiation of
self-consciousness amidst the world; the contrasts of co-operation
and greed, of emulation and loyalty and submission,
of honour and shame, furthered the differentiation
of self-consciousness amidst the tribe.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>If it be asked—how much of all this development attributed
to the hunting-pack might have been brought about just as
well by the formation of a defensive herd, such as we see in
cattle and horses?—a definite answer can be given. The
herd is, of course, marked by (2) gregariousness, (3) perceptive
and contagious sympathy and sometimes effective
sympathy in common defence, (7) recognition of leaders (all
herds that travel have leaders), (8) emulation, (9) precedence;
but not by (1) interest in the chase and in killing, nor (4)
aggressiveness, nor (10) strategy and perseverance in attack,
nor (11) greed; and herd-life affords no conditions for the
development of intelligence and dexterity, nor for any of the
physical characters that distinguish man. Herd-life does
not involve the great and decisive change which is implied
in the evolution of human nature. We must conceive, then,
of the primitive human mind as a sort of chimpanzee mind
adapted to the wolfish conditions of the hunting-pack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Wolves themselves have undergone no great development,
compared (say) with cats, for want of hands and other
physical advantages which we had to begin with. If some
species of baboon had taken to the hunting-life, there might
have been very interesting results.</p>


<h3><a id="ch02_05"></a>§ 5. The Wolf-type of Man established by
Natural Selection</h3>

<p>The differentiation of the human from the anthropoid
stock must have begun a long time ago; as to when it began
there is no direct evidence; and even if fossil remains of the
earlier stages of our evolution had been discovered, we could
only judge from the strata in which they occurred what
must have been their relative antiquity. When it comes
to reducing the chronology of past ages to figures, geologists
either decline to make any estimate, or the results of their
calculations may differ as 1 to 10. Since my own studies
give me no claim to an opinion on such matters, whilst it is
helpful to have clear ideas, however tentative, I shall adopt
the views of Dr. Arthur Keith in his work on <cite>The Antiquity
of Man</cite>, based on estimates published by Prof. Sollas.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> On
turning to p. 509 of that work, a genealogical tree will be
found, showing the probable lines of descent of the higher
Primates. The separation of the human from the great
anthropoid stock is represented as having happened at about
the last third of the Oligocene period—say 2,000,000 years
ago (or, according to the later estimate, 3,500,000). Pithecanthropus
(of Java) branched off as a distinct genus about
the middle of the Miocene. Neanderthal man (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo
Neanderthalensis</i>) and Piltdown man (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eoanthropus Dawsoni</i>)
separated as distinct species (or genera) from the stock of
modern man (absurdly named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</i>) early in the
Pliocene, and became extinct respectively (say) 20,000 and
300,000 years ago. The races of modern man began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
differentiate near the end of the Pliocene (say) 500,000 years
from the present time. Such is the “working hypothesis.”</p>

<p>The skull capacity of the great anthropoids averages 500
c.c.; that of Pithecanthropus is estimated at 900 c.c.; the
Australian native average is 1200 c.c.; Eoanthropus, according
to Dr. Keith, rises to 1400;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> a Neanderthal skull has
been measured at 1600 c.c.; the modern English average
is under 1500 c.c. Of course, mental power depends not
on size of the brain only, but also on its differentiation,
which may have recently advanced.</p>

<p>As to culture, the Neolithic period extends in Western
Europe from about 2000 to 10,000 <span class="f8">B.C.</span>: and to that age
is usually attributed the introduction of agriculture, the
domestication of animals, pottery, weaving, permanent
constructed dwellings, and monuments requiring collective
labour; but some of these improvements may be of earlier
date. In other parts of the world, <abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr> in the Eastern
Mediterranean region, such culture is probably older, but
still comparatively recent. What is known as the Palæolithic
stage of culture is often supposed to have begun early in the
second quarter of the Pleistocene period, giving us a retrospect
of (say) 300,000 years. But if we include under “Palæolithic”
all unpolished stone-work that shows clear signs of
having been executed according to an idea or mental pattern
(and this seems a reasonable definition), the “rostro-carinate”
implements must be so called, and then the beginning of this
culture must be pushed back into the Pliocene.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In Pliocene
(and perhaps Miocene) deposits have further been discovered
numerous “eoliths”: stones so roughly chipped that they
do not imply an idea-pattern; so that, whilst many archæologists
accept them as of human workmanship, some experts
dispute their claim to be considered artefacts. Of course,
there must be eoliths; the only question is whether we have
yet unearthed any of them. Our forefathers cannot have
begun by shaping stones to a definite figure and special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
purpose. Beginning with stones taken up as they lay, they
discovered that a broken stone with a sharp edge inflicted a
worse wound than a whole one; then broke stones to obtain
this advantage; used sharp fragments to weight clubs; and
very slowly advanced to the manufacture of recognisable
axes and spear-heads, meanwhile discovering other uses for
flaked stones; and it seems to have needed at least 1,400,000
(or 2,800,000) years to arrive at the poorest of known palæoliths.
This strikingly agrees with the law, often stated, that
the progress of culture is, by virtue of tradition, cumulative,
and flows, as a stone falls, with accelerating velocity: in
spite of the ebb, to which from age to age we see it to be
liable. At any one time, moreover, the art of stone-working
was, probably, even in adjacent tribes, at different stages of
advancement; it depends partly upon the kind of stone
obtainable; but it has been only recently that such contrasts
could occur as Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> describes among the hosts of
Xerxes: when, beside the well-accoutred Persians and
Medes, marched Libyans and Mysians armed with wooden
javelins hardened in the fire, and Ethiopians with stone-tipped
arrows and spears headed with the sharpened horns of
antelopes.</p>

<p>The moral of all this is that there was abundant time before
the rise of Neolithic culture (which may be called the beginning
of civilisation) for the complete adaptation of mankind
everywhere, by natural selection, to the life of hunters;
and that, since then, there has not been time for the biological
adaptation of any race to the civilised state. We shall see
that natural selection has probably had some civilising
influence; but any approach to complete adaptation has
been impossible, not only for want of time, but also because
of rapid changes in the structure of civilisation, the social
protection of some eccentrics, the persistence of the hunting-life
as a second resource or as a pastime, and by the frequent
recurrence of warfare—that is to say, man-hunting. To
civilisation we are, for the most part, merely accommodated
by experience, education, tradition and social pressure. A
few people seem to be adapted to civilised life from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
birth, and others to the slavish life; but all inherit, more or
less manifestly, the nature of the hunter and warrior. This
is a necessary basis of general and social psychology; and
perhaps tribal or national characters (so far as distinguishable)
may be understood by assigning the conditions under
which they have, in various directions, been modified from
this type.</p>

<p>To avoid the appearance of overlooking an obvious objection,
I may add that the life of the hunter does not imply
an exclusively carnivorous diet, but merely that hunting is
the activity upon which his faculties are bent and upon
which his livelihood chiefly depends. It is most unlikely
that a cousin of the frugivorous anthropoids should entirely
give up his ancestral food, immediately, or perhaps at any
time. Even the diet of the wolf, in North-East Canada,
includes “much fruit, especially the uva-ursi”; and the
coyote there also eats berries;<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> so does the jackal in India.
Savage women everywhere subsist largely on roots and fruits.
Dr. Keith says the teeth and jaws of the Neanderthal species
were adapted to a coarse vegetable diet.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Yet the Neanderthal
burials at La Ferrasie, La Chapelle aux Saints, Jersey
and Krapina, with their implements and animal remains,
leave no doubt that the species hunted the biggest game. At
Krapina, besides mammoth and rhinoceros, “the cave-bear
occurred abundantly, it was evidently a favourite article
of diet”: the inhabitants were not fanatical vegetarians.</p>


<h3><a id="ch02_06"></a>§ 6. Some further Consequences of the Hunting-life</h3>

<p>Between the remote age when our hypothetical ancestor
became a hunter and the time to which probably belong the
remains of the oldest known men, there lies a gap of (say)
one (or two) and a half million years, concerning which we
have not only no direct evidence but not even any parallel
in the world by means of which to apply the comparative
method. Just at the beginning, the parallel of the wolf-pack
sheds some light upon our path; but the light soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
grows faint; for the primitive human, from the first more
intelligent than wolves, and inheriting from the ape-stock
qualities of character which the new life greatly modified
but could not extirpate, must under pressure of selection
have become, after not many ages, an animal unlike any other.
Just at the end, again, something concerning those who
lived many thousand years before the beginning of history
may be inferred from the parallel of existing savage customs;
from their rock-dwellings, drawings, tools, weapons, hearths,
something about their way of life; from evidence of their
burial-customs, something of their beliefs. But what can
be said of our ancestors during all those years that intervene
between the beginning and the end?</p>

<p>Having been a hunter at the first and at the last, we may
reasonably suppose that he had been so all the time. But,
with our present knowledge, our chief guide as to other
matters seems to be the fact that the most backward of
existing savages possess powers of body and mind, and
forms and products of culture, which must have been acquired
gradually through a long course of development from no
better origins than are traceable in apes and wolves. As
the use of good stone weapons by living savages and the
occurrence of stone weapons in deposits of various age in the
Pleistocene—less and less perfectly made the further we
go back—justify us in assuming that there must have been
eoliths of even cruder workmanship at remoter dates, so the
possession by savages of extensive languages, intricate customs,
luxuriant myths, considerable reasoning powers and
even humane sentiments, compel us to imagine such possessions
as belonging to our prehistoric ancestors, in simpler
and simpler forms, as we go back age by age toward the
beginning. A tentative reconstruction of the lost series
of events may sometimes be supported by what has been
observed of the individual development of our children.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) For example, the constructive impulse, slightly shown
by anthropoids that make beds and shelters in the trees,
was called into activity in man especially in the making
of weapons, tools and snares, and became an absorbing
passion; so that a savage (often accused of being incapable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of prolonged attention!) will sit for days working at a spear
or an axe: they are inattentive only to what does not
interest them. Many children from about the sixth year
come under the same sort of fascination—digging, building,
making bows and arrows, boats and so forth. This is a
necessary preparation for all the achievements of civilised
life; and it is reasonable to suppose that the stages of growth
of such interest in construction are indicated by the improvement
of ancient implements.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) As to language—in the most general sense, as the
communication of emotions and ideas by vocal sounds—the
rudiments of it are widespread in animal life. A sort of dog-language
is recognised, and monkeys seem to have a still
greater “vocabulary.” Hence, a number of emotional
vocal expressions was probably in use among the primitive
human stock. And the new hunting-life was favourable
to the development of communicative signs; for it depended
on co-operation, which is wanting in ape-life, and in the
lower extant savages hardly exists, except in hunting, war,
and magical or religious rites. Hunting, moreover, is (as
I have said) especially encouraging to onomatopœic expression
in imitating the noises of animals, etc. It was still more
favourable, perhaps, to the growth of gesture-language in
imitating the behaviour of animals and the actions involved
in circumventing and attacking them. Increasing powers
of communication were extremely useful, and the pack must
have tried to develop them. Without the endeavour to
communicate, there could never have been a language better
than the ape’s; nor could there have been the endeavour
without the need. That gesture alone was very helpful
may be assumed; and it must have assisted in fixing the
earliest vocal signs for things and actions and qualities, and
probably determined the earliest syntax; but when, in
hunting, members of the pack were hidden from one another,
or when their hands were occupied, gesture was not available,
and communication depended on the voice. The speech
of children similarly emerges from emotional noises and
impulsive babbling, assisted by gesture.</p>

<p>Passing to later ages, we cannot expect to learn much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
about the speech of prehistoric men, whom we know only
by a few bones. As to the Java skull, Dr. Keith observes
that “the region of the brain which subserves the essentially
human gift of speech, was not ape-like in Pithecanthropus.
The parts for speech are there; they are small, but clearly
foreshadow the arrangement of convolutions seen in modern
man.” On the other hand, “the higher association areas ...
had not reached a human level.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The jaw of this skull
not having been found, nothing can be said of its fitness for
carrying out the process of articulation. As to Eoanthropus,
“if our present conception of the orbital part of the third
frontal convolution is well founded, namely, that it takes
part in the mechanism of speech, then we have grounds for
believing that the Piltdown man had reached that point of
brain-development when speech had become a possibility.
When one looks at the lower jaw, however, and the projecting
canine teeth, one hesitates to allow him more than a potential
ability.”<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The jaw had not undergone the characteristic
changes which in modern man give freedom to the tongue
in the articulation of words.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> But Dr. Keith “cannot
detect any feature in the frontal, parietal or occipital areas
which clearly separate this brain-cast from modern ones.”<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
Eoanthropus, therefore, must have had a good deal to say
and, being a social animal, must have felt the need of expression;
and, though he was not a direct ancestor of ours, it
can hardly be doubted that at some period the jaws of our
own ancestors were no better adapted than his to articulate
speech. May we not infer that articulate speech, meeting
a need of the stock, arose very gradually, and was slowly
differentiated from some less definite and structural connection
of expressive and onomatopœic vocables, such as
we have seen may naturally have arisen amongst the earliest
hunters? <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pari passu</i> the jaw was modified.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) All savages live by custom; gregarious animals have
their customs; and in the primitive hunting-pack customs
must have been early established as “conditions of gregariousness.”
M. Salomon Reinach, indeed, thinks that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
anthropoid probably became human as the result of inventing
taboos, especially in sexual relations; there was economy
of nervous energy in the direction of the senses, and consequent
enrichment of the intellect.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> His hypothesis does not
carry us far, perhaps, into the particulars of human form
and faculty; but it contains this truth, that without the
growth of customs there could have been no progress for
human nature; and it certainly points to the probability
that some custom was early established with regard to
marriage. In Prof. Westermarck’s opinion our species was
originally monogamous.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Supposing this to have been the
custom, as it is amongst many Primates, could it have
persisted after the formation of the hunting-pack? According
to Mr. Thompson Seton, wolves pair “probably for life”;<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
but this is disputed; and so it is whether or no the male of
a seasonal pair takes part in caring for the puppies.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Of the
primitive human stock one may say that whilst, on the one
hand, the association of many males and females in the
same pack may have tended to break up the family, on the
other hand, the long youth of the children and the parental
care generally characteristic of Primates would have tended
to preserve it; that the practice of pairing requires the
largest number of males (setting aside polyandry), and
lessens quarrelling, and is therefore favourable to the strength
of the pack; and that any custom may have been established
that was most favourable to the species in its new life. The
least probable of all conditions is promiscuity; for the
rearing of children with their ever-lengthening youth must
have been difficult, taxing the care of both parents.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The claim to property is instinctive in most animals—claim
to a certain territory, or to a nest, or lair, or mate.
Each early human pack probably claimed a certain hunting-range;
and each family its lair, which it guarded, as our
domestic dog guards the house. In Australia “every tribe
has its own country, and its boundaries are well known;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and they are respected by others”;<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and the Bushmen,
who retained the ancient hunting-life more perfectly than
any other known people, are said to have been formerly
divided into large tribes with well-defined hunting-grounds.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
As weapons or other implements, charms, or ornaments
came into use, the attitude toward the territory or lair will
have been extended to include them; indeed, it seems to be
instinctive even in lower Primates. “In the Zoological
Gardens,” says Darwin, “a monkey, which had weak teeth,
used to break open nuts with a stone; and I was assured
by the keepers that, after using the stone, he hid it in the
straw, and would not let any other monkey touch it. Here,
then, we have the idea of property.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Among the half-wolf
train-dogs of Canada, the claims of one to property seem
to be recognised by others; for a dog will defend its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cache</i>
of food against another that ordinarily it fears; and “the
bigger dog rarely presses the point.”<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The utility of keeping
the peace within the tribe, no doubt, led to the growth of
customs concerning property, and to their protection by the
social sanction, and later by the taboo.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> For taboo cannot
be the origin of respect for property or for any custom: it
implies a custom already existing, which it protects by the
growth of a belief in some magical penalty that is effective
even when there are no witnesses. The same utility of order
must have established customs of dividing the kill of the
pack: later also protected by taboo, as we still see in many
savage tribes.</p>

<p>The attitude towards property is very variable amongst
the tribes now known to us. Still, considering how early
and strongly it is manifested by children, we may infer with
some plausibility its antiquity in the race. The urgent desire
of property, and tenacity in holding it, displayed by many
individuals, though not an amiable, has been a highly useful
trait, to which is due that accumulation of capital that has
made possible the whole of our material and much of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
spiritual civilisation. Amongst barbarians it may be a
necessary condition of social order. Had not wealth been
highly prized amongst our own ancestors, it is hard to see
how revenge could ever have been appeased by the wergeld.
The payment, indeed, was not the whole transaction; it
implied an acknowledgment of guilt and of the obligation
to make amends; but these things would not have mollified
an enemy nurtured in the tradition of the blood-feud, if
silver had not been dear to him. It is still accepted as
compensation for injuries that seem difficult to measure by
the ounce. Wealth gives rank, and gratifies not only the
greed but also the emulative spirit of the pack. Acquisitiveness
is an essential trait of aristocracy, and adhesiveness of
its perpetuity. Homespun prudence belongs, in our ancestry,
to a more recent stratum of motives; we see it as a blind
instinct in squirrels and beavers, a quasi-instinctive propensity
in dogs and wolves (who hide food that they cannot
immediately devour); but it is not known in any anthropoid,
and is acquired at some stage by some human races—not
by all; for it is not found in many extant savages. The only
occasion on which Australian tribes show prudential foresight
as to food is on the approach of the season of magical rites,
when they lay in a stock of food before giving themselves
up for weeks or months body and soul to thaumaturgy.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
Prudence is not, however, merely a function of foresight or
intelligence, or else the Irish would be as prudent as the
Scotch.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The first wars, probably, were waged for hunting-grounds;
and this may have been a revival, for the carnivorous
anthropoid pack, of a state of affairs that existed amongst
their ancestors at a much earlier date; for battles for a
feeding-ground have been witnessed between troops of the
lower Primates. Such a battle between two bands of langur
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Semnopithecus entellus</i>) has been described;<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and Darwin
relates after Brehm how “in Abyssinia, when baboons of one
species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. gelada</i>) descend in troops from the mountains to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
plunder the fields, they sometimes encounter troops of
another species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. hamadryas</i>), and then a fight ensues.
The Geladas roll down great stones, which the Hamadryas
try to avoid, and then both species, making a great uproar,
rush furiously against each other.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> As packs of the wolf-ape
increased in numbers and spread over the world, they
no doubt generally came to regard one another as rivals upon
the same footing as the great cats and packs of dogs, and
every attempt at expansion or migration provoked a battle.
Wars strengthened the internal sympathies and loyalties of
the pack or tribe and its external antipathies, and extended
the range and influence of the more virile and capable tribes.</p>

<p>It is true that neighbouring tribes of savages are not
now always mutually hostile. In Australia, we are told,
local groups and adjacent tribes are usually friendly;<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
but with them the age of expansion seems to have closed
some time ago, and a sort of equilibrium has been established.
On the other hand, it is a shallow sort of profundity
that insists upon interpreting every war as a struggle for
nutrition, an effort to solve the social problem. Aggressiveness
and insatiable greed are characteristic of many tribes—passions
always easily exploited by their leaders, as in the
civilised world by dynasts and demagogues. Plethora is
more insolent than poverty. Lust of power, of glory, of
mere fighting is a stronger incentive than solicitude for the
poor.</p>

<p>However, in the development of society nothing has been
so influential as war: an immense subject, for the outlines
of which I refer to Herbert Spencer’s <cite>Political Institutions</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Most of the amusements as well as the occupations of
mankind depend for their zest upon the spirit of hunting and
fighting, which they gratify and relieve, either directly or
in a conventionalised and symbolical way, and at the same
time keep alive. Sports and games involve the pursuit of
some end by skill and strategy, often the seizing upon some
sort of prey, or slaying outright, and they give scope to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
emulation. Emulation is a motive in the race for wealth,
in every honourable career, even in addiction to science and
learning: though here the main stress is upon an instinct
older than the pack—curiosity, a general character of the
Primates. That children at first play alone, later play
together, and then “make up sides,” repeats the change
from the comparatively solitary life of anthropoids to the
social life and combined activities of the hunting-pack.
From the interest of the chase and the aggressiveness that is
involved in it must be derived all that we call “enterprise,”
whether beneficent or injurious: a trait, certainly, which
there is little reason to regard as inherited from the anthropoid
stock.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The great amusement and pastime of feeding has, no
doubt, descended to us in unbroken tradition, through
harvest and vintage festivals, from the unbridled indulgence
that followed a successful hunt. And I offer the conjecture
that the origin of laughter and the enjoyment of broad
humour (so often discussed) may be traced to these occasions
of riotous exhilaration and licence. We may suppose,
indeed, that these conditions began to prevail not in the
earliest days of the ravenous pack, but after some advance
had been made in the customs of eating. Savages usually
cram to repletion when possible, and with huge gusto, for
there may not soon be another opportunity. If uproarious
feasting was advantageous physically and socially (as till
recently we all thought it was), addiction to the practice
was a ground of survival; and laughter (a discharge of
undirected energy, as Spencer says), being its natural expression
and enhancement, shared in its perpetuation. This
social origin agrees with the infectiousness of laughter, with
its connection with triumph and cruelty, and with the quality
of the jokes that still throughout the world excite most
merriment—practical jokes and allusions to drunkenness, the
indecorous, the obscene. Sir Robert Walpole preferred such
humour as the most sociable; because in that everybody
could take part. Many refinements have been introduced
in polite circles; but it is in vain that one begins a theory
of laughter with an analysis of the genius of Molière.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly, I suppose that weeping, lamentation and the
facial and bodily expressions of grief were developed by the
social utility of common mourning in tribal defeat and
bereavement.</p>


<h3><a id="ch02_07"></a>§ 7. Moralisation of the Hunters</h3>

<p>We are left to speculate about the earliest growth of
magnanimity, friendliness, compassion, general benevolence
and other virtues. They cannot be explained merely by the
hunting-life, which so easily accounts for greed, cruelty,
pride and every sort of aggressiveness. Robert Hartmann
writes: “It is well known that both rude and civilised peoples
are capable of showing unspeakable and, as it is erroneously
termed, inhuman cruelty towards each other. These acts
of cruelty, murder and rapine are often the result of the
inexorable logic of national characteristics and, unhappily,
are truly human, since nothing like them can be traced in
the animal world. It would, for instance, be a grave mistake
to compare a tiger with a bloodthirsty executioner of the
Reign of Terror, since the former only satisfies his natural
appetite in preying on other animals. The atrocities of the
trials for witchcraft, the indiscriminate slaughter committed
by the Negroes on the coast of Guinea, the sacrifice of human
victims by the Khonds, the dismemberment of living men by
the Battus, find no parallel in the habits of animals in their
savage state. And such a comparison is, above all, impossible
in the case of anthropoids, which display no hostility
toward men or other animals unless they are first attacked.
In this respect the anthropoid ape stands upon a higher plane
than many men.”<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Are we, then, to explain the more amiable
side of human nature, partly at least, by derivation from
the frugivorous Primates, extensively modified by our wolfish
adaptation, but surviving as latent character?</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Several further considerations may be offered to account
for the growth of what we call humanity, (i) The long
non-age of human children is favourable to the attachments
of family life, and such attachments may under certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
conditions be capable of extension beyond the family; but
I cannot trace the whole flood of altruistic regard to the sole
source of maternal or parental love. (ii) Friendliness and the
disposition to mutual aid are so useful to a hunting-pack
that is not merely seasonal but permanent (as I take ours
to have been), both to individuals and to the pack as a
whole, within certain limits (as that the wounded, sick, or
aged must not amount to an encumbrance), that we may
suppose natural selection to have favoured the growth of
effective sympathy, not merely in mutual defence, but so
far as it is actually found at present in backward tribes.
It nowhere seems to be excessive; and its manifestation in
some civilised races seems to depend not upon a positive
increase of benevolence in the generality, but (iii) upon the
breaking down here and there of conditions that elsewhere
oppose and inhibit it. Thus the generosity, mercy and
magnanimity that constitute the chivalrous ideal, depend
(I believe) upon the attainment by a class of such undisputed
superiority that there is no occasion for jealousy or
rivalry in relation to other classes; for should the superiority
be disputed, these virtues quickly disappear. Similarly,
what have been called the “slavish virtues” of charity,
humility, long-suffering may arise amongst those who are
free from rivalry, because they have no hope of aggrandisement
in wealth or honour, and who have indeed suffered
long. With the interfusion of classes, their virtues interfuse;
for they have a common root, and are active, provided that
circumstances do not inhibit them.</p>

<p>(iv) But since in individuals our complex nature varies
in all directions, and amongst the rest in the direction of
benevolence; and since any organ or quality that varies
is apt to continue to do so, and may go on varying even
beyond the limits of biological utility; why in human life
may not this happen with benevolence (or with any other
passion or virtue); so that in some men it expands with
wonderful richness and beauty even to the sacrifice of themselves—nay,
by excessive clemency or generosity, even to
the injury of the tribe or of the race?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The moral sense or conscience has been discussed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Darwin<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> “exclusively from the side of natural history”;
so as this is the way of considering human nature in the
present book, I shall epitomise his account of it; which
seems to be true, and to which I see little to add. He finds
four chief conditions of the growth of a moral sense: (<i>a</i>) the
social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society
of its fellows, to sympathise with them and to help them.
(<i>b</i>) When the mind is highly developed, images of past
actions and motives continually recur; “and that feeling
of dissatisfaction or even misery which invariably results ...
from any dissatisfied instinct would arise as often as it was
perceived that the enduring and always present social instinct
had yielded to some other instinct, at the time stronger, but
neither enduring in its nature nor leaving behind it a very
vivid impression”—as with anger or greed. (<i>c</i>) After language
has been acquired, public opinion can be expressed, and
becomes the paramount guide of action; though still “our
regard for the approbation and disapprobation of our fellows
depends on sympathy.” (<i>d</i>) Social instinct, sympathy and
obedience to the judgment of the community are strengthened
by the formation of habit. Darwin then proves successively
these four positions.</p>

<p>Seeing the stress here laid upon sympathy, it may make
the matter clearer if we observe that the word occurs in
different senses—for the participation in another’s satisfaction
or distress (emotional sympathy) and readiness to help
(effective sympathy); and these are the meanings under (<i>a</i>),
the first of the above heads: and, again, for the knowledge
that there are ideas or judgments in another’s mind together
with approval or disapproval of our actions; and this is
the meaning under (<i>c</i>), the third head. But knowledge of
another’s thoughts is not sympathy, except so far as, being
accompanied with assent to his judgment, there is participation
in his feelings of approval or disapproval; and, if we dissent
from his judgment, there may, indeed, be perceptive sympathy
as to his feelings, but there is no emotional sympathy or
participation in them—there is rather fear or resentment.
It is necessary to bear in mind that perception of another’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
feelings, participation in them and impulse to help or relieve
are separable processes, and that perceptive sympathy is
as active in cruelty as in generosity or mercy.</p>

<p>It may be added that (<i>b</i>), the second of the four conditions
assigned by Darwin as determining the growth of the moral
sense or conscience, accounts more especially for “remorse
of conscience”; and that (<i>c</i>), the third condition, explains
that tone of authority attaching to conscience on which
Bishop Butler laid so much stress.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>How early the moral sense began to form itself in our stock
cannot be estimated because it must have been a very
gradual process. Probably the rudiments of it appeared in
the family life of the ape even before our differentiation;
and the authoritative character of conscience established
itself under the discipline of the hunting-pack before there
was much development of mind (for dogs know what theft
is), and under pressure of a public opinion that managed to
express itself without language. In an original and suggestive
book<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Mr. Trotter has shown that a herd (pack,
tribe or nation) necessarily approves of whatever actions are
done in its interests as good or right, and disapproves of the
contrary actions as bad or wrong. Confident that its beliefs
and customs are good and right, the pack persecutes dissenters
and nonconformists. “Good” is a relative idea. “‘The
good are good warriors and hunters,’ said a Pawnee chief;
whereupon the author who mentions the saying remarks
that this would also be the opinion of a wolf if he could
express it.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Hence we may guess the principal contents
of the primitive categorical imperative. The study of
Ethnology and History enables us to trace the modification
and enrichment of those contents under varying conditions
of culture, and for the results of such study I refer to Edward
Westermarck’s <cite>Origin and Development of Moral Ideas</cite>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) After the introduction of agriculture, the stress of
natural selection was in certain directions altered. At first,
indeed, most agricultural work, probably, was done by
women; but in its progress it fell extensively into the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of men; and then advantage accrued to those tribes that
were capable of steady industry and prudence. The new
employment decreased aggression on the principle that “had
Alexander been holding the plough, he could not have run
his friend Clitus through with a spear.” The sick and aged
were now less an encumbrance than they had been to hunters.
Those who could not endure a settled life wandered away
in their old pursuits. The more aggressive clans slaughtered
one another in the vendetta. Social pressure and hanging
eliminated many of the more idle, improvident, dishonest
and unruly, whose instincts resisted “accommodation.”
The more neighbourly and co-operative tended to predominate.
As civilisation intensifies, the numerous ways of getting a
livelihood, which (as we have seen) derive their motive-force
from the spirit of the pack, gratify that spirit under so many
disguises and with so little direct personal collision, as to be
compatible with a great deal of friendliness and benevolence;
and co-operation, direct or indirect, steadily increases.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Increasing capacity of forming ideas of remote ends
and of co-ordinating many activities in their pursuit, implies
the inhibition of many aggressive or distracting impulses,
and constitutes an automatic control. And although it is
now fashionable to depreciate the power of intelligence in
human life, surely, its development has had great influence.
As men come to foresee the many consequences of action
they learn to modify and regulate it, as each foreseen consequence
excites some impulse, either reinforcing or inhibiting
action. Reflection upon our lot has done much to ameliorate
it. The “conditions of gregariousness” (to use W.&nbsp;K.
Clifford’s definition of morality) have been expounded by
the more penetrating and comprehensive minds—prophets,
poets, philosophers; and some disciples have understood
them and have persuaded many to believe. Nor have such
luminaries arisen only in the later phases of culture when
their writings have been delivered or their sayings recorded.
Probably it was some one man who first pointed out to a
tribe that had ignored the fact, that whether a wrong had
been done by accident or on purpose affected the agent’s
guilt and ought to affect the penalty exacted. Some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
man, probably, first saw what injustice is often disguised by
the specious equality of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex talionis</i>; another first tried
to assuage the bitterness of a vendetta by appointing compensation;
another, perhaps first proposed to substitute
animal for human sacrifice, or a puppet for a slave. And
when we read the lists of sagacious proverbs that have been
collected from many savage tribes, we must consider that
it was by eminent individuals that those sayings were first
uttered one by one: individuals with the gifts of insight and
expression to summarise the experience of a whole tribe in
memorable words, rude forerunners of our prophets and
philosophers.</p>


<h3><a id="ch02_08"></a>§ 8. Influence of the Imaginary Environment</h3>

<p>The necessity of learning the whole art of hunting from its
rudiments, without the help of instinct or tradition, by sheer
observation, memory and inference, put extraordinary stress
upon the brain. At first by knowledge, strategy, co-operation
and persistence of will, later by devising weapons and snares,
evolving language and discovering the ways of making and
utilising fire, man found means of entirely changing the
conditions of his life; but this would have been impossible
without a great development of his brain; and, accordingly,
it appears that Eoanthropus, at the beginning of the Pleistocene,
had a skull with three times the cubic capacity of the
anthropoids. With the growth of the brain came a continually
increasing fecundity of ideas. “Piltdown man saw,
heard, felt, thought, and dreamt much as we do.”<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The
use of ideas is to foresee events and prepare for them beforehand:
the great advantage of distance-senses over contact-senses,
is to give an animal time to adapt its actions to
deferred events; and ideas give this power in a vastly higher
degree. So far the utility of brains and ideas seems obvious.
But in order that ideas may be useful in this way, they
must (one would suppose) represent and anticipate the
actual course of events. If they falsely indicate the order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of nature, or even beings and actions that do not exist at
all, ideas may seem to be worse than useless.</p>

<p>Now, when we turn to the lowest existing savages, they
are found to possess, in comparison with apes, a considerable
fecundity of ideas; constituting, on the one hand, a good
stock of common sense, or knowledge of the properties and
activities of the things and animals around them, and of
how to deal with them, which enables them to carry on the
affairs of a life much more complex and continuous than
any animal’s: but including, on the other hand, a strange
collection of beliefs about magic and spirits, which entirely
misrepresent the course of nature and the effective population
of the world. These latter beliefs, or imaginative delusions,
hamper them in so many ways, waste so much time, lead
them sometimes into such dark and cruel practices, that
one may be excused for wondering whether their bigger
brains can have been, on the whole, of any biological advantage
to them in comparison with the anthropoids. The
anthropoids live by common sense. So do savages, and they
have much more of it; but the anthropoids seem not to be
troubled by magic and animism. We must suppose that
the common sense of primitive man increased age by age,
as he became more and more perfectly adapted to the hunting-life,
and that at some stage his imagination began to
falsify the relations of things and the powers of nature. It
seems that imagination-beliefs depend chiefly upon the
influence of desire and fear, suggestibility, hasty generalisation,
and the seduction of reasoning by analogy. At what
stage imaginations, thus divorced from reality, began to
influence human life, it is impossible to say; but it cannot
be less than half a million years ago, if (as Dr. Keith says)
Eoanthropus, 400,000 years ago, “thought and dreamt
much as we do.” Why did not such delusions hinder our
development? Or did they promote it?</p>

<p>The first consideration is, that biological adaptation is
nearly always a compromise: if any organ or faculty be
useful on the whole, in spite of some disutility, its increase
favours the survival of those in whom it increases; and
this is true of the brain and its thinking. The second is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that nearly all the magical and animistic beliefs and practices
that are socially destructive, probably belong to a stage of
human life that is attained long after our differentiation
has been established, and when some progress has been made
in arts and customs. Savages of the lowest culture have
few beliefs that can be called positively injurious. Talismans
and spells, not by themselves relied upon, but only adscititious
to common-sense actions, give confidence without
weakening endeavour. To curse, or to “point the bone,”
does not create but merely expresses a malevolent purpose;
and, although sometimes fatal by suggestion, is on the whole
better than to assassinate. Taboos do more good by protecting
person and property and custom than they do harm
by restricting the use of foods. Belief in imaginary evils
waiting upon secret sins exerts, whilst supported by social
unanimity, a control upon all kinds of behaviour: it is the
beginning of the “religious sanction,” and one sort of conscience.
The dread of spirits that prowl at night keeps people
in the family-cave or by the camp-fire; and that is the
best place for them. Many rites and observances are sanitary.
Totemism rarely does any harm, and may once have usefully
symbolised the unity of social groups. Totemic and magical
dances give excellent physical training, promote the spirit
of co-operation, are a sort of drill; and (like all art), whilst
indulging, they also restrain imagination by imposing upon
it definite forms. For a long time there was no special
profession of wizard or priest, with whose appearance most
of the evil of magic and animism originates; though probably
even they generally do more good than harm by their courage
and sagacity, by discovering drugs and poisons, by laying
ghosts, and by their primitive studies in medicine and
psychology.</p>

<p>The wizard, however, and the priest, who could never have
existed but for the prevalent beliefs in Magic and Animism,
have a further and far more important function in human
life, namely, the organisation, or rather reorganisation of
society. The organisation of the hunting-pack described
above was liable through several causes to fall asunder. Some
of these causes are obvious: (<i>a</i>) The improvement of weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and snares and discovery of poisons made very small parties,
or even single families, self-sufficing—as among the Bushmen
(though they sometimes assembled for a grand hunt).<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> (<i>b</i>)
Failure of game from desiccation, as in Australia, or because
the tribe has been driven into a poor country like Tierra del
Fuego; so that a small population is scattered over a wide
area, and reduced to a greater or less dependence on “collecting.”
(<i>c</i>) The adoption of even a primitive agricultural or
pastoral life may make hunting a secondary interest. In
such cases the natural leaders of a clan are no longer (as in
the old pack) plainly indicated; and if society is to be saved
from anarchy, some new control must establish itself for the
preservation of tradition and custom. Conceivably this
happened in several ways; but in fact (I believe) we know
of only one, namely: First, the rule of wizards, who are
chiefly old men credited with mysterious power that makes
the boldest tribesman quail, such as the headmen and elders
of an Australian tribe. In New Guinea, too, and much of
Melanesia, the power of rulers, even though recognised as of
noble birth, depends chiefly upon their reputation for Magic.
And among the Bushmen secrets about poisons and antidotes
and colours for painting (probably considered magical) were
heirlooms in certain families of chiefs, and gave them caste.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Secondly, at a later stage, as the belief in ghosts more and
more prevails, and ancestral ghosts are worshipped, and
ghosts of heroes or chiefs become veritable gods, the priests
who celebrate their worship strengthen the position of chiefs
or kings descended from these gods, and help to maintain
more comprehensive and coherent governments than those
established upon Magic only; though to these later forms,
also, and to Religion itself magical beliefs contribute their
support. The inevitable development of illusory imaginations
along with common sense, then, assisted early and
also later culture, because they preserved order and cohesion
by re-arousing the ancient submission and loyalty of the
pack. For common sense is always limited to present conditions,
it could never have foreseen the dependence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
human life upon order and the necessity of maintaining
cohesion even at great immediate sacrifices. These interests
were, therefore, served indirectly through delusions; natural
selection must, within certain limits, have favoured the superstitious.
Excessively imaginative and superstitious tribes
may sometimes have been eliminated; for common sense also
has biological utility. But, perverse as it may seem, imaginations
utterly false have had their share in promoting “progress”:
co-operating with agriculture and trade, magic,
religions and the fine arts have, by supporting government

<br />BELIEF AND SUPERSTITION</h2>


<h3><a id="ch03_01"></a>§ 1. Superstition</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Inasmuch</span> as the influence of superstition upon the history
of society can hardly be exaggerated, it must be worth while
to inquire into its origin and nature. But this inquiry leads
into a quagmire of ambiguous words: and to attempt to
define them for all purposes would entangle the discussion
in endless controversies. So it will be best to explain merely
in what sense certain words will be used in this book. “Superstition,”
for example, means in common use (I think) false
beliefs concerning supernatural powers, especially such as
are regarded as socially injurious, and particularly as leading
to obscurantism or cruelty: but it is often extended to cover
beliefs of a negligible or frivolous kind, such as stories about
“fairy-rings,” or the unluckiness of seeing the new moon
for the first time through glass. Plainly the injuriousness
of a false belief is often in dispute, and at any rate is a question
of time and place. “Superstition,” then, is here used merely
as a collective term for the subjects of the ensuing chapters—Magic
(or the belief in occult forces) and Animism (or the
belief in the activity of spirits).</p>

<p>The consequences of a belief, again, whether good or evil,
cannot affect its psychological character: in trying to explain
its nature and origin, one cannot take account of its social
values. The explanation of superstitions must hold of
all false beliefs, whatever their utility or disutility. Nay,
further, whether a belief is false or true does not necessarily
affect its psychological character: for a man may hold two
doctrines, one true and the other false, both derived from the
sincere testimony of the same person, and he may not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
able to discern any difference in the degrees of confidence
with which he holds them or in their influence upon his conduct.
The understanding of false belief, then, requires an
examination of belief in general.</p>

<p>Still, whilst in the mind of any given man a true and a
false belief may have the same character and origin, considered
generally they must surely have different origins and grounds;
and to make the sequel clearer, I will anticipate its conclusions
so far as to say that true beliefs seem to rest on perception
or inferences verified by perception, and false beliefs seem to
depend upon imagination that cannot be verified. This
general statement will need several qualifications. But I
rely upon it at present so far as to say that superstitions are
essentially imagination-beliefs.</p>

<p>We shall find that these superstitions, though often held
by whole tribes with the utmost assurance, differ in some subtle
way from the perception-beliefs of their common sense,
as that “fire burns” and that “water quenches fire.” They
are unstable: (1) they become active on occasions, and otherwise
are apt to be forgotten—as ghosts are only thought of
at night. (2) They are modifiable merely for the sake of
economy or other convenience. (3) They lose their hold on
a tribe, fall off and die in course of time without any change
in the evidence for them. (4) They depend a good deal upon
the assent of a crowd. (5) They often vary in neighbouring
countries or families, or amongst the members of a family.
This is not like common sense. Superstitions or imagination-beliefs
are unstable, in spite of being often held with great
obstinacy (so that people die for them), and of their enduring,
in the simpler forms and at a certain level of social life, for
thousands of years. There is something wanting in the holdfast
or anchorage of imagination-beliefs.</p>

<p>It is necessary to explain what I mean by “imagination.”</p>


<h3><a id="ch03_02"></a>§ 2. Imagination</h3>

<p>Is it enough to define “imagination” as merely the having
of mental “images,” pictures before the mind’s eye? This
would confine imagination to visual representations, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
exclusion of auditory, olfactory, etc., which are all a man
born blind can have, and which sometimes occur to those
who can see, though the visual are commonest. The word
“images,” therefore, is sometimes used to cover all these
modes of representation; though “phantasmata” would be
better.</p>

<p>Again, a mental image or phantasm, visual or auditory, is
improperly called an imagination, if there is nothing more than
the reproduction of a single sense-quality. Imaginations
represent not abstract sensations, but perceptions. To see
an armed knight is not merely to have a visual impression
of him, but to perceive a living, solid, heavy object definitely
in space; and imagination reproduces the whole of this,
and otherwise would be quite uninteresting. What would
the tournament in <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> amount to if the knights were
only phantoms?</p>

<p>Further, imagination, merely as a reproduction of perception,
is not distinguished from memory; but, in use, the two
are always contrasted. Memories are recognised (in their
complete form) as returning to us from earlier experience,
both their component pictures and the order of them, and
they are relatively stable; imaginations are felt to be more
or less novel, and can easily be modified. Probably all the
elements of an imagination might have occurred in a memory;
but the arrangement of these elements is often so different
from any actual experience as to baffle every attempt to redistribute
them amongst their sources. Hence, in normal cases,
our attitudes toward a memory and toward an imagination
are entirely different. If a seeming memory prove false,
we say it was only an imagination.</p>

<p>But, once more, a good many men never have images or
phantasmata (except words), or very few or faint ones, or
only when falling asleep, and so on. Yet they are not wanting
in imagination; words or other signs serve them instead of
images to carry all meanings (the important matter); they
enter into the spirit of poetry and literary fiction: so that
imagination may be active without images. And the fact
seems to be that the effectiveness of mental processes depends
very little upon phantasmata, but upon something much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
deeper in the mind; and that there exist in men all degrees
of concrete representative power, from those who picture
everything they think of with vivid and definite detail, down,
through many stages of decreasing realisation, to those who
have only faint or fragmentary “images,” or even none at
all: without its being possible to say (at present) that one
type of mind is better or worse than another; though they
may be adapted to different tasks.</p>

<p>Expectation and reasoning, which are closely allied (for
every definite expectation is a sort of inference), are often
carried on in pictures—“picture thinking”—and this also
is called imagination. Tyndall’s brilliant address on <cite>The
Scientific Uses of the Imagination</cite> is well known. It greatly
helps some men in thinking to form pictures of what they
think about, such as a machine or an anatomical specimen,
as if they had the thing before them; or even of an atom,
which no man ever has before him, and which cannot be
imagined by reproducing the precept, but only by constructing
a picture from much grosser materials according to concepts.
The picture thus formed necessarily falls short in some ways
of the thing thought or meant, and can only be prevented
from misleading us by guarding it with definitions or rules
or abstract ideas; and this shows that the effectiveness of
thought, the deeper process mentioned above, is a concatenation
or evolution of meanings or general ideas, and that it is,
in part, by illustrating these that pictures are useful: they
also serve to fix attention, as words do.</p>

<p>Thus reasoning may express itself by imagination. On
the other hand, imagination is more frequently contrasted with
reason, as dealing in fiction, not reality. Our confusion is
shown thus: to call an historian imaginative is depreciatory;
yet it is as bad to say he is wanting in imagination. In the
latter case, we mean that he fails adequately to conceive
the events he treats of; in the former, that he embellishes or
distorts them with unverifiable representations.</p>

<p>Again, the term “imagination” is sometimes confined to
intellectual processes in the fine arts: dramas, novels, etc.,
are works of imagination. Now dramas and novels all proceed
upon one method, namely: they begin by stating or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
insinuating an hypothesis concerning certain persons in a
given situation, and then deducing (that is reasoning out)
the consequences, occasionally helping the plot by further
assumptions: at least that is how it appears, though probably
the main incident of the plot is thought of first, and then
an hypothesis is framed that conveniently leads up to it.
And if the reasoning is feeble, and if the subsidiary assumptions
are too numerous or too facile, we say the work is flimsy
or improbable—allowing for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i>; for a romance is
not expected to be as probable as a modern novel. <cite>Gulliver’s
Travels</cite> afford the most perfect example of this method;
for each voyage begins with a frank absurdity—men six
inches or sixty feet high, a flying island, rational horses;
but this being granted, the sequel makes tolerable logic.
Well, many scientific investigations seem to follow exactly
the same method—begin with an hypothesis, deduce the
consequences, and occasionally help out the argument with
further hypotheses (though that is not all): and here again
the conclusion is usually thought of first, and the hypothesis
invented to explain it. If it be said that the scientist believes
his hypothesis to be true, whilst the romancer does not, it
may be replied that the scientist sometimes expressly warns
us that his assumption is only a “working hypothesis,”
which may not be true (though he thinks it may be), whereas
early epic poets and minstrels often regarded their work as
by no means without a foundation in fact.</p>

<p>Imagination and reasoning, then, are closely allied or
interwoven, and the contrasting of them depends entirely
upon this, that there is a sense in which imagination is not
a presentation of truth or matter-of-fact, whether it is believed
to be or not; and a sense in which reasoning is devoted solely
to the discovery of truth concerning facts, and to that end
is protected by a methodology, carefully comparing its
premises, carefully verifying its conclusions; whereas the
imagination that is contrasted with reasoning knows nothing
of a methodology nor of verification. Even the modern
novelist, a great part of whose hypothesis is usually true—the
present state of society, facts of history or geography,
etc.,—does not pretend to present a truth of fact. It belongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to his art to play at reasoning; he has learnt to play the game
very well; but it remains play: he aims at and attains not
truth but verisimilitude. And when we look back on the
history of fiction we see (on the whole) the verisimilitude
growing, age by age, slighter and fainter; till in early romance
and poetry it is disturbed and broken and destroyed by stories
about monsters, impossible heroes, magicians and gods,
believed at one time to be true, and just the same as stories
still believed by barbarians and savages, but which we believe
no longer.</p>

<p>It is such stories as these last, including all superstitions,
that I especially call “imagination-beliefs.” The term
includes all false beliefs, but with the rest I am not directly
concerned. How are imagination-beliefs possible?</p>


<h3><a id="ch03_03"></a>§ 3. Belief</h3>

<p>Belief is here used to denote the attitude of mind in which
perceptions are regarded as real, judgments as true of matters-of-fact,
actions and events as about to have certain results.
It is a serious and respectful attitude; for matter-of-fact
compels us to adjust our behaviour to it, whether we have
power to alter it or not. Hume describes belief as having
a certain “force, vivacity, solidity, firmness, steadiness;
influence and importance in governing our actions”;<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and
these terms are quite just, but most of them are synonyms;
and the whole dictionary will not make anybody understand
what belief is who has never felt it. However, there is no
such person.</p>

<p>The quality of this attitude (or the “feeling” of it) as a
specific “state of consciousness” is difficult to observe,
because (like pleasure or displeasure) it is always marginal
to something else in the focus of attention, some object,
judgment or action; but we can appreciate it in its variations
by considering the very different degrees of “force, steadiness,”
etc., which characterise several beliefs regarded as more or
less probable. The degree of belief ought to correspond with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the weight of evidence: if evidence for any judgment is
complete and uncontradicted, it may be called 1, and the
corresponding state of mind should be “certainty”; if
evidence for it there is none, or if evidence for the contradictory
judgment is complete, it may be called 0, and the state of
mind “disbelief.” Between these extremes there is room
for an infinite series of fractions, and for corresponding shades
of doubt (which, of course, do not really occur); and in the
middle, at ½, there should be suspension of judgment. But
most of these refined attitudes are the luxury of a few men
severely trained in estimating evidence, and by them enjoyed
only in the departments they have been trained in. For
the mass of mankind, a very few shades of confidence or
dubiety fill up their scale of judgment-values; and these
may be far from corresponding as they should do with the
quantity or quality of the evidence; and the nearest they
get to suspension of judgment is a state of hesitation between
alternatives that by turns seem equally likely. Disbelief,
though the opposite logically to belief, as rejection to acceptance,
has, nevertheless, much in common with it—the character
of finality and positiveness, which is often (perhaps
always) derived from belief in something else which is
incompatible with the given judgment.</p>

<p>When the attitude of belief is established in one’s mind
by evidence clearly conceived, whether by the examination
of facts or the weighing of arguments, it is called “conviction,”
and so is the process of bringing it about; but if it results
from considerations imperfectly appreciated, and from
emotional appeals, especially when urged by another person,
it may be called “persuasion,” though the word describes
the process rather than the result. Most imagination-beliefs,
including all superstitions, are persuasions.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the test of the strength of
one’s belief is its influence upon our actions—where the test
is practicable. With full belief one acts “confidently”
(a significant verbal proposition!); in doubt, hesitatingly
or cautiously; in disbelief, not at all, or in the sense of the
contrary belief. But we cannot always judge of a man’s
beliefs from his actions; for he may be actuated by several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
beliefs, and we do not know what they are. And popular
actions that involve no loss or hardship may express mere
assent without belief.</p>

<p>There is a kind of imagination-belief, and the purest kind,
which has nothing to do with evidence: it is often called
“make-believe” or “play-belief”: the entering into or
contemplating some activity, which we know to have no
direct bearing on our necessary interests, with as much ardour
and absorption as if it were the only important thing in the
world: as in games and sports, especially in drama and
romance. This is one of the many things that do not astonish
because they are so common; and the usual (and probably
the true) explanation of it is, that this state of mind is of
the utmost utility in giving zest to play, especially during
youth. For many animals share in this spirit; and the young
of the higher animals, which enjoy a long protected youth,
pass the time chiefly at play, and thereby develop and train
all their faculties, physical and mental. It somewhat outlasts
youth in many animals, and conspicuously in ourselves,
some having nothing better to do (and they might do worse),
and others relieving from time to time the strain or tedium
of work and, in some sort, prolonging youth into middle age;
till play becomes gradually less engrossing.</p>

<p>This play-belief depends entirely upon imaginative excitement;
and it shows that the attitude of belief may be adopted
voluntarily, or fall upon us (as it were) by surprise and maintain
itself for a time in great strength: with many at a melodrama
it runs to anxiety, weeping and anguish; and this
not only without evidence, but in spite of the knowledge that
this is London, whose magistrates would never permit such
doings: only one forgets London, with all its dull conventions
of law and order. Attention is engrossed by the play.</p>

<p>Play-belief has the same traits as were said above to mark
superstitions: (1) it becomes active on occasions, and otherwise
disappears; (2) it is always modifiable for convenience
or by a change of taste; (3) it loses its hold and tends to die
out in a man as time goes on; (4) it is strengthened by the
assent of an excited crowd; (5) the objects of such beliefs
are very variable. We shall find that in other ways there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
is a close alliance between superstition and play. But, certainly,
superstition has a much deeper hold upon our nature;
for it not only excites fear and anxiety, but itself is born of
those passions: the desire of security and confidence, the
dread of impending and unknown perils, these are its life
and strength. So that the wonder is that superstitions are
not more enduring. And the truth seems to be that the
tendency to adopt superstitions does endure at a certain level
of mentality, though particular superstitious beliefs are
mutable; just as in the individual, a disposition to play
outlasts many particular modes of recreation.</p>

<p>Belief, then, is an attitude of mind in which we may find
ourselves for good reasons, or for bad reasons, or for none
at all; sometimes even slipping into it voluntarily or involuntarily
when we know the situation is unreal; indeed, an attitude
in which, in play or earnest, we pass our lives, unless
something happens to arouse doubt or criticism.</p>


<h3><a id="ch03_04"></a>§ 4. Causes and Grounds of Belief</h3>

<p>The source, direct or indirect, of all belief is perception.
In perception must be included, for subjective studies, introspection;
though being difficult to keep steady, to repeat
and to compare with the observation of other minds, it carries
less conviction. As to perception we say that “seeing is
believing”; and, in fact, an object holds the eye in a way
that vouches for its own reality; but, if we suspect that our
eyes deceive us, reassurance comes with the handling of the
thing. Belief has sometimes been discussed as if it were
chiefly concerned with ideas or the relations of ideas; and
systems of philosophy have sought justification in the coherence
of ideas, with little or no regard (not to say with contempt)
for the coherence of ideas with perceptions. But
nearly the whole of every man’s life (savage or philosopher)
passes in an attitude of unquestioning belief in the evidence
of his senses; and it is thence that belief extends to ideas
on a presumption of their representing reality. We know
that a perception may be fallible, but perceptions and the
comparison of perceptions in the long run overrule everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
else; and experimental methods consist in taking precautions
against the errors of perception, and in bringing every hypothesis
to the test of perception.</p>

<p>Further causes of belief are either Evidentiary, which
(though often misleading) may generally be justified on
reflection as raising some degree of probability, and which
may, therefore, be called “grounds”; or Non-evidentiary,
which (though very influential) cannot, on reflection, be
justified as having any logical value, and are, therefore, causes
only and not grounds.</p>

<p>(1) Evidentiary grounds of belief are (<i>a</i>) memory, which
is plainly indispensable if we are to learn by experience; and
(<i>b</i>) testimony, which must be trusted if language is not to be
useless and social co-operation impossible: both these grounds
are supposed to rest upon the primary rock of previous perception,
but are slippery and treacherous. Memory is only
valid so far as it truthfully represents original experience,
and testimony only so far as it presents (i) a valid memory,
(ii) correctly reported. Hence in serious matters precautions
must be taken against their fallibility: otherwise they are
not good evidence. A specious memory, so far as it is false,
is imagination; and false testimony, so far as it reports (i)
a false memory or (ii) an invention of the reporter, is also
imagination. Testimony gathers force, as a cause of belief,
with the numbers and consideration of those who support
it, and is especially strengthened by their unanimity; but,
as a ground of belief, it depends only on their knowledge
and truthfulness. A third ground of belief is (<i>c</i>) inference;
which is necessary to all original adjustment of our conduct
to the future or to unperceived circumstances, but highly
fallible, and constituting the chief problem for the exercise
of Logic when that science arises: especially to explain the
conditions of valid observations and experiments, of probability,
of the conclusion of an argument being covered by its
premises, and of the sufficiency of verification. False
inferences that cannot be verified are imaginations.</p>

<p>As the growing mind of society deals with true beliefs
they are piled up and classified in systems of science and
philosophy: in which systems each belief or judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
strengthens and is strengthened by the rest. Even without
systematisation, the mere structural similarity of judgments,
formed unconsciously on the same implicit principles of
causation and classification, throws them into those loose
apperceptive masses which we call “common sense.” Such
systems or masses, whether of science or of common sense,
readily assimilate and confirm new inferences having the
same character, and offer resistance to all inferences having
a different structure, such as those about magic and spirits.
The selective power of these apperceptive masses over novel
ideas constitutes “understanding,” and is the plain solid
man’s substitute for Logic; and so it is with many scientists,
who often neglect the abstract study of Logic. For these
systems or masses of experience are the substance of Logic and
Methodology, which are their skeletons abstracted from them.
They are the basis of all effective comparison and criticism;
agreement or disagreement with them is the test of truth
or error. It is the chief defect of common sense that the
verification of its judgments depends almost entirely upon
repetition of experiences (what Logicians call “simple enumeration”),
without that analysis of observations which alone
can show the necessary relations of facts; but this defect
is in some measure remedied in good minds by that power
of unformulated ideas of natural order, the result of unconscious
analysis, which we call “good judgment”—a
power which the fortunate possessor may be unable to
explain.</p>

<p>(2) Non-evidentiary causes of belief are all reducible to
bad observations, imaginations, and the causes that excite
imagination; and bad observations are caused by false
imaginations as to the meaning of sense-data. If it should
seem to any one that since imagination consists of ideas it
must be by nature incompatible with intense belief, we must
consider that memory, the effects of testimony, and inferences
also consist entirely of ideas; so that in that character they
do not differ from imagination. Even perception depends
for its meaning upon implicit ideas, and erroneous perception
is due to erroneous ideas. The weakness of imagination-belief
which (despite its frequent intensity) always in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
becomes manifest, is due to its not being constantly confirmed
by experience.</p>

<p>In detail the non-evidentiary causes of belief are as follows:
(<i>a</i>) not only the truths of experience become massed or
systematised in common sense and science, but the errors
of misinterpreted experience and tradition form similar
aggregates. Coincidences mistaken for causation, illusions,
dreams, tales of thaumaturgy and ghost-stories, so far as
they have anything in common in their outlines or emotional
tone, form apperceptive masses which function in the same
way as scientific systems: each of their constituent beliefs
strengthens and is strengthened by the rest; and each mass
(as a delusive “understanding”) readily assimilates and
confirms any new tale or illusion having its own character,
and resists and repels every judgment having a different
structure—and, therefore, refuses explanation. And just
as science and common sense have a sort of internal skeleton
of principles which has been exhibited as Logic, so some of
these comparatively obscure and chaotic masses of illusion
and tradition contain certain structural principles which,
though unconscious at the lowest human level, obtain recognition
as culture advances—for example, the principles of
mimetic and contagious magic; and then, too, arise such
caricatures of science as theogonies and cosmologies, chiromancy,
astrology and so forth. But nothing ever emerges
from them that can be called a test of truth or methodology;
much less, of course, can such a thing be found at lower levels
of culture. There you see the accumulating clouds of imagination-belief,
which gather together from all the winds and pile
themselves up to overshadow poor humanity age after age;
which still, in our own world, are by no means dissipated;
and to whose persistent influence we may (I suppose) attribute
the mysticism that periodically infects philosophy itself.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Contributory to these masses of error are bad observations,
confused and distorted memories, dreams and corrupted
testimony and tradition, all of them having their
origin in some sort of experience and matter-of-fact, and all
issuing in vain imaginations. For of course there is no such
thing as imagination underived from experience; experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
is distorted and corrupted by superstition, but it transfers
to superstition the attitude of belief that always belongs
to experience, and supplies materials from which (as we shall
see) it is often possible to construct such a defence of superstition
as, to an unsophisticated mind, must be very plausible
and persuasive.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Direct experience is often interpreted by
a story in such a way as to make the story more credible.
If a stone is shown as marking the tomb of a hero, or a cleft
in the mountain as proving the prowess of a wizard, one
unconsciously transfers the attitude of belief involved in
contemplating these relics to all the legends concerning those
mighty men of old.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The causes determining belief are reinforced in various
ways by feeling and emotion. The agreeableness or disagreeableness
of any judgment draws attention to, or diverts
it from such a judgment and the evidence for it: except that
some disagreeable emotions, especially fear, by a sort of
fascination of attention, are favourable to belief in the reality
of an imagined evil. They possess the whole mind.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Every desire fixes attention upon beliefs favourable
to it, and upon any evidence favourable to them, and diverts
attention from conflicting beliefs and considerations. Thus
every desire readily forms about itself a relatively isolated
mass of beliefs, which resists comparison and, therefore (as
Ribot says),<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> does not recognise the principle of contradiction.
Incompatible desires may be cherished without our becoming
aware of their incompatibility; or, if the fact obtrudes itself
upon us, we repudiate it and turn away.</p>

<p>The more immature a mind, again, and the less knowledge
it has, the less inhibition of desire is exerted by foresight of
consequences that ought to awaken conflicting desires or
fears; and the less compassion one has, the less is desire
inhibited by its probable consequences to others: therefore,
in both cases, the less check there is upon belief.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Voluntary action in connection with any belief, whether
of a rational kind or in the routine of rites and ceremonies,
favours that belief: (1) by establishing the idea-circuit of
means and end, the end suggesting the means to it, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
thought of means running forward to the end—a circuit that
resists interruption: (2) by the general effect of habit and
prejudice; for every habit of action or of thought has inertia,
and, moreover, it is agreeable, and to break it is disagreeable;
so that, again, a relatively isolated system is formed, which
resists comparison and criticism.</p>

<p>On the influence of desire and of activities for an end
depends “the will to believe.” We cannot believe anything
by directly willing it; but we can will what to attend to, or
what to do, and that determines belief.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Finally, belief is determined by certain social influences
besides testimony and tradition: especially by sympathy
and antipathy between families, parties, tribes; and by
imitativeness and suggestibility (qualified fortunately by
contra-suggestibility); so that beliefs become fashionable,
endemic, coercive, impassioned and intolerant. The power
of a crowd to inflict its passions and beliefs upon the individual
has recently been much explained: it has always been
practically understood by wizards, priests and politicians
who lead mankind by the ears. Suggestibility, in general, is
the liability to follow example or testimony without criticising
it; and for many people it is so easy to fall into the attitude
of belief upon slight provocation, that this liability, to the
extent of weakness, is very common. Contra-suggestibility
in general is the opposite tendency. But special suggestibility
(I should say) is the liability to adopt a belief on testimony
not only in the absence of evidence, but against
evidence; and contra-suggestibility is the liability to reject a
belief against the evidence. They are merely extreme cases.
If you draw two equal straight lines, A and B, and say, “It
seems to me that B is longer than A,” one person will reply
“Certainly,” another “Certainly not; A is the longer.”
The art of suggestion consists in reducing your audience to
this state of imbecility; it requires you to bring them into
such a condition of exclusive attention to your words that,
comparison and criticism being excluded, their natural disposition
to assent shall (for the time) have free play. The
specially suggestible person is easily thrown into this state
of exclusive attention, as if hypnotised. He who is suggestible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
by one man may not be so by another; or he may be more
suggestible in the line of his prejudices than against them.</p>


<h3><a id="ch03_05"></a>§ 5. The Beliefs of Immature Minds</h3>

<p>All these grounds and causes of belief, evidentiary and
non-evidentiary (except Logic and Science) are common to
both mature and immature minds: but their proportional
influence with individuals or with societies is very different
at different stages of development; and in immature minds
and in the lower stages of culture, the power of the non-evidentiary
causes is excessive. Probably the chief cause
of the growth of common sense in the generality of men is an
increasing regularity of social life, as (notably) in the bloom
of the classical civilisations and in the last four hundred years.</p>

<p>Perception, in normal circumstances, is accepted by all
as a matter of course or, rather, of necessity: it controls
the activities of practical life in hunting and in industry,
in making weapons, hoeing the ground, building houses:
however, these labours may sometimes be modified or interrupted
by the intrusion of beliefs derived from other sources.
If a savage sings a spell to his prey, or weapon, or tool, or
keeps the head of a slain enemy on a shelf that his victim’s
soul may assist him as a slave, he may thereby increase his
own confidence in the work of hunting or gardening; but,
otherwise, if his work be no better, neither need it be the worse
for such fancies. The properties of matter exact practical
recognition, without which nothing can be done. Even
magical practices presuppose a sane perception of the central
facts: as who is acting, for what purpose, when and where,
with what and toward whom. Upon this basis there may be
an astonishing superstructure of imagination-belief; but there
are limits to the effectiveness of such beliefs.</p>

<p>M. Levy-Bruhl, indeed, in a very interesting book, maintains<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
that, under the influence of social ideas (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">représentations
collectives</i>), the primitive mind actually perceives things
differently from what we do. Whilst we succeed in attaining
an objective presentation, eliminating subjective associations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
with primitives <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">propriétés mystique</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forces occultes</i> are integral
qualities of the object. He grants that, in certain cases of
immediate practical interest, we find them very attentive
and able to discriminate slight impressions, and to recognise
the external signs of an object on which their subsistence
or even their life depends; but holds that, in a very great
majority of cases, their perceptions are over-weighted by
subjective elements. This doctrine reverses (I venture to
think) the real relations between perceptions and other causes
of belief and their proportionate influence in savage life.
It is not only where subsistence or life is at stake that backward
peoples see things as they are: in merely experimental
tests, Dr. Rivers found amongst both Papuans and Todas,
that, as to suggestibility in perception, they showed a high
degree of independence of judgment.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Their confidence in
perception is not, like imagination-belief, occasional, modifiable
for convenience, liable to lapse in course of time, dependent
on the assent of a crowd. So far as occult or mystical
attributes are by a savage assigned to things, such as magical
force to a weapon, they constitute a secondary, imaginary
integration with the percept. Such imaginary attributes
cannot, like perception attributes, be verified by sensation:
compare the hardness of a spearhead with its magical force.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of savage beliefs is due, not to corrupt
and clouded perception, but to the influence of desire and
anxiety upon their imagination, unrestrained by self-criticism
and reinforced by the popular consensus. The savage’s
imagination is excited by the pressing needs of his life in
hunting, love, war, agriculture, and therefore by hunger and
emulation, hate and grief, fear and suspicion. Imaginations
spring up in his mind by analogy with experience; but often
by remote or absurd analogies; and there is no logic at hand
and not enough common sense to distinguish the wildest
imaginative analogies from trustworthy conclusions. The
same pressing needs and the same emotional storms often
affect a whole tribe, and simultaneously stimulate every one’s
imagination; and originating (no doubt) in ancient times and
slowly accumulating and condensing, there grows up a mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of public imagination-beliefs, which are inculcated into every
individual by tradition and common ceremonies. Such beliefs
embodied in stories and formulæ, and associated with rites
and customs, have for a long time the strength of custom
in governing the behaviour of individuals and in tribal respect;
but they prove at last to be weaker than custom, inasmuch
as the observances may continue whilst the beliefs are forgotten
or replaced by others, as the progress of culture makes
it necessary to think of the old rites in a different way. In
their flourishing period they extensively influence practical
affairs, sometimes helpfully or harmlessly, sometimes injuriously
and disastrously. In general, imaginations are prevented
by biological necessity from modifying a tribe’s conduct
beyond certain limits; but, exceptionally, they result
in tribal insanity, tending toward, if not accomplishing, the
tribe’s destruction, as in extreme cases of the practice of
human sacrifice or of the ordeal by poison.</p>

<p>Indeed, so violent and tyrannous is the power of superstitious
beliefs in many cases, that it may be difficult to
understand how they are almost entirely born of the imagination.
In a civilised country there are always current some
beliefs as imaginative and absurd as any to be found in the
middle of Africa; but surviving amidst a greater mass of
perception-beliefs and positive ideas about industry and
commerce, they have lost much of their driving power; and
when the imaginative character of any belief has been recognised,
it passes into the region of fine art or mythology, or
even of ridicule. If such things have any place in our life,
we turn to them of personal choice in the intervals of affairs.
Under the influence of the fine arts or of literature treating of
such things, our emotional states may be intense; but they
are dissociated from action, exist for their own sake, have an
appropriate tone (æsthetic) which marks their lack of energy,
so that they require only an imaginary satisfaction. With
a backward people there is much less “positive” opposition
to their imaginative prepossessions and pursuits; what seems
to us absurd, seems to them necessary; the actions and observances
that express their beliefs are not performed as a matter
of personal choice, but of public custom; the ends to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
obtained (they think) are the same as those of what we call
“business.” And it must be so. Considering the function
of superstition in promoting political evolution, it is plain
that primitive man must have been capable of believing
and doing those things which (within certain limits) had so
much biological and social value.</p>

<p>To understand how the magical and religious beliefs of
savages and the play-beliefs of civilised man, having a common
source in imagination, are (in spite of strong contrasts) closely
allied, we must call to mind the many degrees of intensity
of play-belief in ourselves, varying from the momentary
entertainment of playing with a child, through many grades
of fiction or ceremony, down to a deeply serious frame of mind,
a profound movement of dread or compassion that may long
outlast our play. A child’s absorption in such beliefs is
more intense than ours; but circumstances prevent his attaining
to the solid faith of a savage. The child of civilised people
has little or no support in tradition (except from nursemaids);
he is not driven by the desires and anxieties of subsistence;
and he is frequently interrupted by his seniors. The savage
has an overwhelming tradition and authority, pressing
anxieties and no seniors. Until the civilised sceptic reaches
his shores, there is, for the average tribesman, nothing but
tardy experience or social fatigue to check his vagaries. His
imagination vies with the sense of reality, often overpowers it;
yet his beliefs show many signs of their insecure foundations.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>It is not only the influence of society and tradition that
renders imagination-beliefs coercive to a savage; in the
immature mind of the individual there are certain conditions
favourable to their prevalence.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The process of imagination itself, the memory and the
picture-thinking of savages, seems to be more vivid, sensuous,
stable, more like perception than our own normally is. “The
Australians,” says Spencer and Gillen, “have the most wonderful
imagination.”<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> They often die of it; and so do
Hindoo peasants, Maories, Fijians, Negroes and others, if
they know they have been cursed or have broken a taboo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
With the Melanesians, says Dr. Coddrington, thinking
is like seeing;<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and Dr. Rivers has confirmed this statement.
Hence there is a tendency to accept imaginations as perceptions
are accepted; and to believe in the efficacy of rites,
because the mere performing of them with an imagined purpose
makes their purpose seem to be accomplished. When a
man of intense and excited imagination makes an image
of an enemy, and stabs it, that his enemy may suffer, his
action gratifies the impulse to stab, as if he wounded the
enemy himself, and revenge seems to be a present fact.
Similar intensity of imagination is found in civilised children—greater
than in ordinary adults. Savages, again, seem to
dream more vividly and convincingly than is usual amongst
ourselves, and are said to be more liable to hallucinations.
Physiological conditions of the immature brain (childish or
savage), in which excitement does not rapidly spread through
many associated neurones, may be the basis of the vividness
of imagination, dreaming and hallucination.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) But more important than any intensity of picture-thinking
to the growth and persistence of imagination-beliefs,
is the want of a mental standard, by which they might
be discredited. It is true that even at a low level of culture
individuals are found for whom common sense constitutes a
private standard, and who are sceptics in relation to their
tribal beliefs.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> But such a private standard cannot be
communicated, and for the great majority of the tribesmen
common sense is no confident guide; and perhaps they are
even incapable of effectively comparing their ideas. At any
rate, one reason why we believe our memories and not our
imaginations is that, whilst in both cases the images (or
elements of images) entering into them are derived from
experience, in memory the relations of images in place, time
and context are also derived directly from experience;
whereas in imagination images (or their elements) are reconstructed
in relations in which they have never been experienced,
by analogies of experience (often distorted) or by
condensations the most capricious. Therefore, to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
imaginations credible to us, even in play, the relations of
experience must be faithfully imitated, as (<abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>) in <cite>Robinson
Crusoe</cite>; or else our emotions must be so strongly excited as
to possess our minds with the fiction to the exclusion of all
criticism. But with immature minds observation of fact,
outside the practical, repetitive, necessary course of life, is
not exact and coherent; and, accordingly, their memories are
not coherent, especially as to time-relations; so that, by
comparison with such memories, irregular imaginations suffer
little. There is not enough orderly memory or general knowledge
to discredit even absurd imaginations; for so far as
observation and memory are disorderly, generalisation, conscious
or unconscious, is impossible. Hence not only traditionary
myths may be monstrous and arbitrary, but occasional
tales of private invention, amongst both children and savages,
usually exhibit disconnected transitions and impossible
happenings. Yet they satisfy the immature mind.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) There are certain other conditions of the immature
mind that hinder the comparison of ideas and, therefore, the
criticism of beliefs. About every imperative need, such as
success in hunting, with its desires and anxieties, rites and
ceremonies grow up to gratify imaginatively the desires and
relieve the anxieties; and ideas of these observances form
relatively isolated systems. To us these ideas usually seem
absurd and irrelevant when compared with the savage’s own
experiences and his other practices. We see a hunter, for
example, endeavour to gain his ends by two distinct series of
actions. In one he fasts, enchants his weapons, casts spells
upon his expected prey; in the other he carefully prepares
his weapons, patiently tracks his prey, warily approaches and
slays it. The latter series we approve and appreciate as
causation; the former we ridicule as hocus-pocus, contributing
objectively nothing to the event (though probably it increases
his confidence); and we pity “the heathen in his blindness.”
And, indeed, he may be said to be mind-blind; for in observing
the rites, his attention is so occupied by means and end,
and caught in the circuit in which these ideas revolve, and he
is so earnest in carrying out the prescribed actions, that he
cannot compare them with the really effective actions, so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
discover their absurdity and irrelevancy. In short, a state
of mental dissociation is established for the system of magical
ideas. So far does illusion go that he seems to regard the rites
as the most important part of his proceedings. But that is
not really his deepest conviction: he trusts in Magic and
keeps his bowstring dry.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) In the case of children we may assume, and in the
more backward races of men we may suspect, that the comparison
of judgments is difficult, or sometimes even impossible,
because of the imperfect development of the cerebral cortex.
There must be some structural conditions of the free flow of
energy through all organs of the brain, corresponding with the
associability and comparability of all ideas. We may doubt
if these conditions are complete even in good cultivated minds;
since everybody finds one or another study or art especially
difficult for him, or the freeing of himself from this or that
sort of prejudice especially repugnant. And it is not only
deliberate comparison that is hindered in the immaturity of
the brain, but also that automatic process (more or less
unconscious) of assimilation and discrimination to which (I
think) we owe most of the results of abstraction and generalisation
that may seem to have required purposive comparison.
Such imperfections of structure, greatest at the lowest levels
of organisation, and gradually decreasing as ideal rationality
is approached, we may call “incoördination”; and, so far
as it obtains, the results must be somewhat similar to the
discoördination, the breaking down or interruption of
organic efficiency, that occurs in hysteria, hypnosis and some
forms of insanity. One of the results probably is suggestibility—the
tendency to accept what is told, or insinuated,
without examination; for freedom from this common liability
depends (apart from the contra-suggestible disposition) upon
the rapidity and definiteness with which one can compare
that which is suggested with present fact or with one’s
knowledge and former experience; and this is hindered by
incoördination.</p>

<p>Effective incoördination may, however, be merely functional
for want of practice in thinking; and it exists often
enough in civilised people, because they have not even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
desire to be consistent. In either case, whether from defective
structure or from the dull inertia of disuse, there will be failure
of comparison and, therefore, of criticism, and also (we may
suppose) a greater intensity of imagination and of dreaming
and a liability to hallucination, such as is said to be frequently
the case with immature minds.</p>


<h3><a id="ch03_06"></a>§ 6. The Reasoning of Immature Minds</h3>

<p>We have seen that many beliefs result from inferences, and
that inferences, when logically justifiable, may be considered
as grounds (raising some degree of probability); but, when not
justifiable, they are only causes of belief and their results
are only imagination-beliefs. Since the general nature of
reasoning is the same for Socrates and Sambo, we must
inquire into the particular nature of the reasoning which
leads immature minds into such bewildering mazes of error
as we see (for example) in the world-wide prevalence of Magic
and Animism.</p>

<p>On the inductive side of knowledge (the obtaining of
premises) there is, of course, much imperfect observation and
hasty generalisation; but, in spite of these faults, a savage
learns by repeated experiences a great many narrow general
truths about the physical world, plants, animals and his
fellow-men, which constitute his stock of common sense and
on the strength of which he lives as a very intelligent animal.
We shall find from time to time errors of observation (such
as the taking of a dream for reality) and of generalisation
(such as the classing of worms with reptiles); but, strictly
speaking, this is not reasoning: all reasoning is deductive,
and the immature mind’s deductive processes need a fuller
analysis.</p>

<p>Our Logic consists of a few universal principles generally
accepted, with which any more particular judgment may be
compared in order to test its validity. The matter may be
superficially acquired in a few hours; but the full comprehension
of it implies the widest comparison of types of judgment
from all departments of knowledge: Logic being (as I
have said) a sort of skeleton of knowledge. Hence in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
mind incapable of comparison and criticism—or so far as it
is incapable—there must be an absence of Logic. So much
effective comparison of experience, however, goes on without
our specially attending to it that a man’s logical power bears
no proportion to his investigations into the structure of
knowledge. One man may be a great student of Logic and
a very inefficient reasoner from a want of discipline in the
world of fact; another, who has never opened a text-book,
may yet show by the definiteness of his judgments and the
adequacy of his plans, that he is a sort of incarnate Logic,
that his mind works according to reason or (in other words)
according to the order of facts. It is the highest manifestation
of common sense. Such men occur among backward
peoples.</p>

<p>The only universal principles that need be considered
here are the Law of Causation and the Form of Substance and
Attribute (Mill’s doctrine of Natural Kinds): which may be
called the principles of parallel reasoning; because the greater
part of ordinary reasoning consists in drawing some inference
parallel to one or the other of them, usually in some restricted
shape. For example, a restriction of causation is the proposition
that “exposure to intense daylight causes sun-burn,”
of substance and attribute that “the specific gravity of gold
is about 19·5”: whence we infer that if we expose ourselves
to sunlight our faces or hands will suffer, or that any piece
of gold will be relatively very heavy. But in such cases
erroneous inferences are easy: for example, to expect that
exposure to London sunshine will cause sunburn; for there
the foul atmosphere cuts off the actinic rays: or to expect
that a lump of brass will have specific gravity 19·5. A
necessary precaution before trusting an inference, therefore,
is the ascertaining that the inference deals with the very
same sort of case as the premise describes: else there is no
complete parallel. And Logicians show in the form of the
syllogism this necessary precaution—to use their favourite
example in a case of Substance and Attribute:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="syllogism">
<tr>
  <td align="right">Major premise</td>
  <td align="center">—</td>
  <td align="left"><em>All men are mortal</em>;</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td align="right">Minor premise</td>
  <td align="center">—</td>
  <td align="left"><em>Socrates is a man</em>;</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td align="right">⁂ Conclusion</td>
  <td align="center">—</td>
  <td align="left"><em>Socrates is mortal</em>.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p class="noi">The conclusion <em>Socrates is Mortal</em> is parallel to the major
premise <em>All men are mortal</em>; and that it deals with the very
same sort of case is secured by the minor premise, <em>Socrates is
a man</em>. Whoever reasons must see to it that this premise is
true. But the savage has never noticed that necessity; and
thence come most of his errors.</p>

<p>The syllogism (it is now admitted) does not describe the
way in which we reason, but is only a form which gives
some help in testing the validity of reasoning if one should
ever think of doing such a thing. In practice we do not think
first of the major premise, then of the minor premise and lastly
of the conclusion. As a rule we do not think of either premise
at all: the “conclusion” comes first to mind. In certain
circumstances of association, because of our hopes or our
fears, it occurs to us that “Socrates is mortal.” If some one
should doubt this judgment and ask for proof, we might
think of the major premise, and then put it into words for the
first time—“All men die;” even then it might not seem
necessary to add that “Socrates is a man.” But although
we may not have been at the time aware of these premises
until we were asked for them, their presence in the mind in
some way was necessary to determine the inference: the
major premise was there as latent memory of one or more
cases of people who had died; the minor premise was represented
by the assimilation of the case of Socrates to those
cases of mortal men. The former experiences have left an
engram, which serves as a mould into which subsequent
experience may run, and which conceivably may determine
subsequent judgments even though the former experiences
can no longer be remembered.</p>

<p>The phrase “form of thought” is most used for premises of
high generality, such as the axioms of mathematics, causation,
substance and attribute, space in three dimensions; and,
undoubtedly, these are forms which determine the lines of
all thinking to which they are relevant; but they would be
useless, if there were not, under them, forms established in
very concrete material by the repetition of simple experiences
and ordinary events (or even by single impressive events),
such as “men are mortal,” “water quenches fire,” which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
determine the lines of common-sense judgments. If there
has been an experiential judgment—X is related to Y, when
X again appears it is expected to be related to Y.</p>

<p>Amongst savages also, of course, experience settles in
their minds such forms of thought; both the most general
ones, which they never formulate but which necessarily
control their thoughts, and many particular ones concerning
the experience of daily life; which last control the details of
their thoughts, and for practical purposes are true; but which,
through ignorance of the minor premise, are allowed to
assimilate many judgments of a very different nature. Thus,
X being known to be related to Y, they are apt to infer that
things that are like X, or which they suppose to be like X,
are also in the same way related to Y; and this is disastrous.
In civilised life, most occupations are so mechanical, and the
general tradition is so positive, that there is little encouragement
to think nonsense; so that the average man reasons
tolerably about simple matters without having heard of the
minor premise; but the savage’s life is much less regular,
and less fully occupied, and the tradition is full of magic and
ghosts. Accordingly, he is always ready to think about
magic and ghosts; and since his thoughts about such things
can only run in the mould of his experiences (with some playroom
for amplification, distortion and condensation), whilst
he is also ignorant of the function of the minor premise, he
seems to draw often from a very sound major premise a very
absurd conclusion. For the minor premise is an invention
of Logicians (perhaps their greatest): it does not occur to
cursory, but only to critical thought.</p>

<p>For example, a savage judges that to put a lock of a man’s
hair in the fire injures and may destroy him: how comes he to
think so? He has learnt by experience that for a man to put
his hand in the fire, or to fall into it, hurts him; and this
supplies the mould in which his inference about the lock of
hair is cast. Similarly, he is apt to judge that to throw a man’s
image into the fire hurts him and may destroy him; and this
clearly rests upon the same experience. His reasoning
assumes the minor premise that (for the purpose of his revenge)
a separated part of a man, or his image, is the same as the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
himself; and this assumption is made explicit in the famous
maxims of Magic, that in rites, whatever has been in contact
with a man—or that any likeness of a man—may be substituted
for him. But the generalisation of these maxims is
left for an advanced stage of culture; the savage, who acts as
if he held them, has never thought of, much less formulated
them. They are derived, by later thought, entirely from an
analysis of his conduct in magic. What the causes are that
determine him to act as if he accepted the maxims of Magic will
presently be discussed.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>There are certain other reasonings implied in savage
practices, where the error lies not so much in the minor
premise as in the minor term, thus: It is matter of experience
that a sense of personal power and elation is produced by
dancing and singing; and (perhaps without remembering
such experience) a savage infers that magical power is
increased by the same means. Or, again, it is matter of
experience that men eat and use solid food and weapons; and
a savage infers that ghosts eat ghostly food and use ghostly
weapons; that is to say, that where food and spears are left
at a tomb and remain untouched, the ghost has taken to
himself the soul of these things which was his proper share.
Now granting that there are such things as magical powers
and ghosts, the reasoning that identifies them respectively
with physical power and with men is, for the purpose of the
inference, not unplausible; with a liberal examiner the minor
premises might pass. But if magical powers and ghosts
do not exist, the minor terms are imaginary.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In short,
all these reasonings turn upon imaginations. The experiential
major premises are true enough, but the minor premises
are illusory, and as it is a maxim with Logicians that the force
of reasoning follows the weaker premise, the conclusion is
illusory. It is not in perception but in imagination that a
part is the same as the whole, or that a likeness is the same as
the thing itself; that magic controls events and that ghosts
haunt their sepulchres.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>These reasonings are fallacious imitations of parallel
inferences according to cause and effect; but there are others
of a kind peculiar to imagination: I mean reasonings by
analogy—as when a Zulu, courting the dusky fair, chews a
piece of wood, in the expectation that, as the wood is reduced
to pulp, her heart, too, will be softened. These processes
are not parallel; there is no resemblance between a lady’s
heart and a piece of wood, nor between mastication and court-ship;
but the relation involved, the softening process, is
felt to be the same in both connections and, therefore, the
cases on the whole are thought to be the same. Many rites
and observances depend upon such analogies—for this is the
strict sense of analogy, “like relations of unlike terms”;
and they have a leading part in the formation of myths in
which natural events are represented as personal relations—Apollo
chasing the Dawn, and so forth. And I formerly
thought that such arguments as the foregoing, in which the
actions of ghosts are identified with those of men, or the
sufferings of a part are equated with those of the whole,
were examples of analogical reasoning; for certainly, the
terms involved are different: a ghost, or an image, or a nail-paring
is not the same as a man. But, on reflection, I see
that though these terms are really different, that has nothing
to do with the psychology of the matter, for they are conceived
by the savage to be the same; and, therefore, the inference
is conceived as parallel to the experiential ground (even
though this remain latent in consciousness).</p>

<p>Analogical thought is now understood to be imaginative
only, and is confined to the metaphors and similes of poetry
or rhetoric; though it is not very long ago that it was seriously
trusted in argument, as in defending absolute monarchy in
the State by the examples of patriarchy in the family, and
even by the supposed “regiment” of bees and quails in their
societies, of the lion over beasts and of the eagle over birds.</p>

<p>In this spirit, Malays, having identified the life of the
rice plant with human life, regard the flowering rice as in
its infancy, and proceed to feed it with pap: and carry out
the analogy at further stages of its development. Similarly,
to facilitate childbirth, or to liberate the struggling soul of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the dying, it is a respected recipe to untie all knots, unfasten
all buttons, unlock all doors, open all windows; for opening
or loosing, no matter what, is always the same process-relation.</p>

<p>These seem to be the chief modes of fallacious thinking—(1)
false parallels and (2) analogies—which mislead the
untutored mind and give to imagination-beliefs such coherence
as they ever attain. Two accounts of superstitious reasoning
have been given by those who admit that savages reason
at all; one is that they reason correctly from absurd premises;
the other that they reason absurdly from correct premises.
If the foregoing analysis is sound, there is some truth and
some error in both these doctrines. So far as primitive
ratiocination is purely analogical, it is quite futile, whether
its premises be true or false; for it cannot be cast in any
admissible logical form. So far as in superstition it imitates
parallel reasoning, according to cause and effect or substance
and attribute, the major premise is, for the most part, empirically
true; the minor premise is false; and the conclusion
is a vain imagination. There are three types of ratiocination:
(1) equations, as in mathematics; and here primitive man for
a long time got no further than the counting of things by his
fingers and toes. (2) Parallels of premise and inference,
according to causation or substance and attribute, as in the
physical and natural sciences; and here the savage collects
by experience much common sense, and by inevitable fallacies
much superstition. (3) Analogies of imagination. The
natural progress of reason consists in relegating analogies to
poetry and rhetoric; in introducing greater and greater
accuracy into the judgments that serve as major premises,
and greater caution in assuming minor premises; at last, in
counting and measuring the facts reasoned about, and so
preparing the beginnings of mathematical method. Such
progress is promoted by the high biological value of greater
definiteness of thought. Immature man in the necessary
practical life—which may be called the biological life—has
many definite perceptions and judgments and well-adjusted
actions; outside that life, in the region of superstitious
observance, he is not a rational, but an imaginative animal.</p>

<h3><a id="ch03_07"></a>§ 7. General Ideas at the Savage Level</h3>

<p>The language of savages is often wanting in names of
classes of things for which names are with us a matter of
course, and it has been supposed that those who use the
language must be without the corresponding general ideas.
Thus it is reported that a tribe had a name for each kind of
tree but none for tree in general; another had a name for
coco-nuts at various stages of growth (when they serve different
uses) but none for coco-nut at all times: therefore, it is
inferred, they had no general idea of tree or of coco-nut. A
Siberian example is still more remarkable. The Tunguses
depend entirely upon reindeer for food, clothes, tents and
locomotion, and keep herds of them; yet they have no name
for the animal. But they have a name for wild and another
for tame reindeer; a name for domestic reindeer that have
been broken in, and another for the unbroken; a name for
the female fawn, for the doe with young, for a doe with one
fawn, a doe in the third year with two fawns; a name for
each age-class of buck, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Are we to infer that the
Tunguses have no general idea of reindeer?</p>

<p>It was, no doubt, natural to assume that we first perceive
individuals, which now stand clearly before us, and then,
having compared them, arrive at general ideas. But if
knowledge grows by the assimilation and differentiation of
experiences, the class on the one hand and the individual
on the other, must be joint products of this process: classes
becoming clearer as more and more individuals are discriminated.
Classes, or class-ideas never stand before us as
individuals do; but the greater part of the meaning of every
perception of an individual is the kind of thing it is. And as
to priority, to perceive the kind of thing is (biologically) far
more important than its individuality. If the individual
did not mean the class, to perceive it would be useless as a
guide to action. The general idea derived from the assimilation
of experiences is the apperceptive mass that converts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
sense-stimulation into cognition: when unconscious Romanes
called it a “recept.”</p>

<p>The primitiveness of general ideas is shown by gesture-language,
which probably precedes speech, and which (except
in direct indication of what is thought of) depends wholly
upon general ideas suggested by imitative or significant
actions. Primitive language must have described things by
general characters, so far as it consisted in onomatopœia;
to growl like a lion could only suggest the kind of animal.
Primitive drawing (whether by children or savages) is nearly
always generic: dog, horse, frigate-bird, hammer-headed
shark, but not any individual.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that savages are capable of general
and abstract ideas; and no one now supposes that language is
an adequate measure of thought. A language contains names
only for things, groups, and aspects or actions of things which
the people who use it need to discuss: if they do not need to
speak of abstractions, there are no words for them. But we
cannot assume of the contents of the mind, any more than of
the outside world, that things do not exist unless we have
noticed and named them. Professor Franz Boas has shown<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
that languages of the northern Amerinds, that do not idiomatically
express abstract ideas, may be made to do so without
violence, and that the abstract expression is intelligible to
men native to the languages. “Every one who knows
people of low culture,” says Dr. Rivers, “must recognise
the difficulty which besets the study of any abstract question,
not so much because the savage does not possess abstract
ideas as that he has no words of his own to express
them.”<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the ideas attained by savages, and having an
important part in their lives, though often taken for granted
and unexpressed, are some of the highest generality: for
example “force.” The notion of force is derived from the
experience of effort in our own muscular exertions; but with
the development of our perception of physical objects by
the integration of sense-data—sight, touch, movement and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
resisted movement (kinæsthesis), smell, hearing—this sense of
effort, being transferred to objects as equivalent to our own
exertions about them, becomes the all-important core of every
object (or meaning of every perception of an object), without
which the thing would be a mere show, neither useful nor
injurious—sheep and tigers, rocks and pumpkins alike
indifferent. Probably the perceptions of all the higher
animals (down to reptiles) have this meaning. Force is
reality, and by primitive man is thought of as the essence of
whatever he conceives of as real, such as spells, talismans and
ghosts. Having a subjective ground, from which it never
becomes free, the notion of it is indefinite, varies for each of
us with our constitution, age, health, and not only lends
itself to the wildest whims of superstition, but has misled
scientific investigations.</p>

<p>Relations are a class of general ideas familiar to savage
thought, often appreciated with great subtlety and especially
prominent in some magical operations. Relations are not
only thought of by savages but compared, and likenesses
discovered between them that may often surprise us. A
gardener of New Guinea, having planted taro, ensured the
growth of the crop by saying: “A muræna, left on the shore
by the tide, was exhausted and on the point of expiring,
when the tide returned, and it revived and swam away.”
And he struck the ground with a branch three times.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> He
saw that renewal of life in the muræna and in the taro were
the same thing; so that to describe one must strengthen the
other—such is the “force” of a spell!</p>

<p>The most important relation involved in knowledge and in
its practical applications is causation. Savages who have
no word for causation and have never thought of it in the
abstract, must always act as if they assume it. This is apt to
be misunderstood. It is written: “The natives [of Australia]
have no idea of cause and effect. They notice that two
things occur one after the other, and at once jump to the
conclusion that one is cause and the other effect.” They have,
then, some idea of the relation, though ill-discriminated.
Thus, having noticed that the plover often cries before rain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
they imitate the cry when performing rites to bring on rain.
We rather suppose that an atmospheric change, preceding
the approaching rain, excites the plovers. But that does not
occur to the natives: that “one after the other” is the same
as effect after cause, or (as Logicians say) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc, ergo propter
hoc</i>, lies at the bottom of innumerable superstitions. The
subconscious control exercised by this latent form of thought
is very imperfect. The maxims of indirect Magic, that a
likeness may be substituted for the thing itself, or a part of
it for the whole, are merely formulæ of causation assumed
under an erroneous belief as to what can be a cause. There
are cases in which the like may be a substitute (one man for
another) and a part may nearly serve for the whole (part of
a broken knife). Hence these principles were stated and
avowed by physicians and alchemists of the Middle Ages, and
observed in their practice.</p>

<p>The quantitative axiom of mediate relation—“Magnitudes
equal to the same magnitude are equal”—is, of course, never
expressed by savages; but it is practically understood and
applied by them whenever they use a common measure—the
fingers for counting, the pace, or hand or arm-stretch to
measure distance. These devices are gesture language; and
the truth which the gestures assume has been forced upon the
observation of primitive men whenever they saw three or
more nearly equal things together—men in a row, birds in a
flock, eggs in a nest. We need not suppose that conscious
analysis is necessary to determine the relations between such
things; the brain has its own method of analysis; and some
day we learn the results. It was late in the day that the
results became known; not, apparently, till the Greeks gave
scientific form to the rudiments of mathematics. For then,
for the first time, articulate axioms were wanted—to satisfy
the form of science. The innumerable exact calculations
of Egypt and Assyria could go on very well without them.
Their discovery required the specific purpose of a scientist in
search of them, the state of profound meditation and abstraction,
excluding all irrelevant ideas, when in the emptiness
and darkness of the mind their light became visible, like a
faint sound in a silent room. Thus an idea, whose functioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
has for ages controlled thought without being recognised,
suddenly takes its place in the organisation of knowledge.</p>


<h3><a id="ch03_08"></a>§ 8. The Weakness of Imagination-beliefs</h3>

<p>With immature minds their superstitions seem to rest on
good evidence. Some of those who pray to Neptune are
saved from shipwreck, and the drowned are forgotten: all
confirmatory coincidences are deeply impressive, and failures
are overlooked or excused. By suggestion the sick are often
healed, and the hale are struck down. Curses and incantations,
if known to the intended victim, fulfil themselves. So
do good omens that give confidence, and bad omens that
weaken endeavour. If a magician has the astuteness to
operate for rain only when the wet season approaches, the
event is likely to confirm his reputation. Sleight of hand,
ventriloquism and the advantages of a dark séance are not
unknown to sorcerers tutored in an old tradition of deceit,
and their clients take it for demonstration. The constant
practice by a whole village of both magic and industry for
the same end, makes it impossible for ordinary mortals to
see which of them is the real agent of success. For the
failures of magic or of sacrifice the practitioners always have
plausible explanations. Hence between imagination-beliefs
and perception-beliefs, as to their causes, there may be, for
the believers, no apparent difference.</p>

<p>But in character, also, imagination-beliefs may seem
indistinguishable from perception-beliefs; in immediate feeling-quality
they are certainly very much like them; and, on a
first consideration, they appear to have as much influence
over men’s actions: but this is not true. We must not infer
that to suffer martyrdom for a cult (as witches have done) can
be a sign of nothing but unalterable faith in it: besides
fanaticism and other abnormal states of mind, one must allow
for loyalty to a party or leader, for oppositeness and hatred
of the persecutor, for display, self-assertion and (in short)
for a strong will. Those who take part in a religious war—are
they driven wholly by enthusiasm for the supernatural, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
not at all by hatred of aliens, love of fighting and hope of
plunder? Discounting the admixture of other motives,
the power of imagination-beliefs is, with most people, much
less than we are apt to suppose. They are unstable, and in
course of time change, though the “evidence” for them
may remain the same. Moulded from the first by desire and
anxiety, they remain plastic under the varying stress of these
and other passions. In a primitive agricultural community,
preparation of the soil, hoeing, reaping and harvesting go on
(though with inferior tools and methods) just as they do with
us; and from age to age the processes are generally confirmed
or slowly improved. At the same time, every such employment
is surrounded by a sort of aura of rites, which seem to
be carried out with equal, or greater, scrupulosity and conviction;
yet, age by age, these rites slowly atrophy and lose
their importance and their ancient meaning, which is explained
by new myths; or other rites may be learnt from neighbours
or from invaders; for some rites may be necessary to their
life, though not any particular ones.</p>

<p>The unstable character of superstitions and their close
alliance with play-beliefs may be shown in various
ways:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The rites which express them are often carried out with
deception, practised on the crowd in a public performance,
as by obtaining from heaven a shower of rice, which (over
night) has been lodged in the tree-tops, and is shaken down
at the decisive moment; or, in private practice, played off
on the patient, by bringing a stone in one’s waist-belt and
then extracting it from his body. Half the tribe may deceive
the rest, the men mystifying the women and children, or the
old the young.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Religious beliefs often comprise incompatible attitudes:
the worshippers of a god acknowledge in prosperity his
superior wisdom and power—at the same time, perhaps,
employing devices to cheat him; or, in long continuing
distress from drought or war, they may threaten to punish
him, withhold his sacrifices and desecrate his shrine. In
Raiatea, when a chief of rank fell ill, extravagant rites and
sacrifices were practised; but if these failed, “the god was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
regarded as inexorable, and was usually banished from the
temple, and his image destroyed.”<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Imagination-beliefs break down under various trials—such
as economy, selling the Rice-mother when the price of
grain rises; offering the gods forged paper-money instead
of good, or leaving many things at a grave and taking back
the more precious; self-preservation, as in substituting the
king’s eldest son for himself in sacrifice; compassion, in burying
with the dead puppets instead of slaves (though in this
economy may have some part), or substituting in sacrifice a
bull for a man.</p>

<p>In such cases as these we see how any desire, whose satisfaction
is incompatible with a given belief or observance,
tends to create a limiting belief and to modify the rites.
Social indolence and fatigue—the product of many individual
fatigues and occasional levity, whereby the meaning of rites
is forgotten, and the rites themselves are gradually slurred
and abbreviated—must be an important condition of the
degeneration of rites, as it is of language. Foreign influence
through trade or war introduces disturbing ideas that appeal
to lovers of novelty, and show that other people with other
beliefs are as well off as ourselves. Even repeated experience
of failure may shake a man’s confidence and make him throw
away his fetish: though usually he gets another.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The beliefs of Magic and Animism are generally supported
by intense emotional excitement during the incantations
and ceremonies that express them. Emotion is artificially
stimulated and, probably, is felt to be necessary in
order to sustain illusion. It excludes criticism and increases
suggestibility.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The specific connexion of such beliefs with the play
attitude is shown: by their rites including games, such as
leaping, swinging, spear-throwing—supposed to have some
magical efficacy; the ceremonies themselves are often
dances, dramas, choruses; and with the degeneration of
belief, the rites remain as dramatic or musical pastimes,
whilst the myths survive in epic poems, fairy-tales and
ghost-stories. When rites and incantations are not intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to incite to immediate action, it is necessary that the emotions
generated in their performance shall subside with only an
imaginary satisfaction: they, therefore, acquire the æsthetic
tone of beauty, or sublimity, or pathos (or some rudimentary
form of these feelings); so that the performance, thus
experienced, becomes an end in itself.</p>

<p>These beliefs with their correlative ceremonies have a
further resemblance to play in the indirectness of their
utility. Play develops faculty; but no child thinks of that.
Magic and Animism (as we have seen) tend to maintain
custom and order; but this is not known to any one at first
and hardly now to the generality. Rites of public interest,
to procure rain or to encourage the crops, though useless for
such purposes, gratify the desire to do something, or to feel
as if something were being done toward the end desired,
especially in the intervals when really effective work cannot
be carried on, as whilst the crops are growing or after harvest:
they allay anxiety and give hope and confidence. Moreover,
they are organised pastimes—not that they are designed to
pass the time, but that they have in fact that valuable
function. The men of backward societies, during a considerable
part of their lives, have not enough to do. Social
ceremonies keep people out of mischief, and, at the same time,
in various ways exercise and develop their powers. With
us industry is a sufficient occupation, or even too engrossing,
and circumstances keep us steady; so that, in leisure, pastimes
may be treated lightly. With the savage some pastimes
must present themselves as necessary periodical religious
duties, whose performance (in his belief) encourages and
enhances industry. So far, again, as needs and interests
are common to a tribe, village or other group, these ceremonies
ensure social co-operation and unity and also emulation in
their performance; and they preserve tradition and the
integration of successive generations. Our games are free
from practical hopes and anxieties; but the more elaborate,
such as horse-racing, have still a social function; or, like
cricket and football, a tribal character: the school, college,
county or even the nation feels deeply concerned about them.
The Olympic Games, which interested the Greek world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
throughout all its scattered cities, have been traced back
to primitive religious observances.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>As for the dark side of superstition, it needs no other
explanation than crime, fanaticism and insanity: which
also are diseases of the imagination. Jealousy, hatred, greed,
ferocious pride and the lust of power are amongst the causes
that mould belief. Any calling pursued in secret, like that
of the sorcerer, under a social ban, is of course demoralised.
Where the interest of an organised profession stands in a
certain degree of antagonism to the public interest, it may
become the starting-point of unlimited abominations; and
of this truth the interests of magicians and priests have
supplied the most terrific examples. Dwelling upon what
you know of black magic and red religion, the retrospect of
human culture fills you with dismay; but need not excite
astonishment; for human nature is less adapted to its environment
(chiefly social) than anything else in the world; the
development of the mind and of society has been too recent
for us reasonably to expect anything better.</p>

</div>


<h3><a id="ch04_01"></a>§ 1. Antiquity of Magic</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Magic</span>, until recently, was somewhat neglected by those
who treated of savage ideas. In Sir E.&nbsp;B. Tylor’s <cite>Primitive
Culture</cite> only one chapter is given to Magic, against seven to
Animism (belief in the agency of spirits). In Spencer’s
<cite>Sociology</cite>, Part <abbr class="no-it" title="1">I.</abbr> is almost wholly devoted to the genesis and
development of Animism, without a single chapter on Magic.
The importance of early Animism became such an obsession,
that travellers observed and reported upon it wherever they
went, making only casual references to Magic—much to our
loss. The tradition of this way of thinking seems to run
back to Hume’s <cite>Natural History of Religion</cite>, where he traces
the development of religion from a primitive belief that all
natural activities are like our own, and that everything is
possessed and actuated by a spirit. This idea was adopted
by Comte, and elaborated in his celebrated law of the three
stages of the explanation of Nature as determining the growth
of human culture: Fetichism, which ascribes all causation
to the particular will of each object, and which by generalisation
leads through polytheism to monotheism; Metaphysics,
which, giving up the notion of personal will, attributes
the activities of things to abstract forces; and Positivism,
which, discarding the variety of forces that can never be
known, turns to the exact description of the order of phenomena.
Mill, in turn, adopted these doctrines from Comte,
and gave them currency amongst us, as part of the extraordinary
influence which for many years he exerted upon all
our thoughts. Hence the priority of Animism to every other
theory of things seemed at that time a matter of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Recently there have been signs that this conception of
primitive thought is giving way to another, namely, that
Animism was preceded by Magic. Sir J.&nbsp;G. Frazer puts it, that
the idea of Magic is simpler than that of Animism; that Magic
is found in full force amongst people whose Animism is feebly
developed, and that its beliefs are more uniform throughout
the world.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Substantially—with qualifications that will
appear hereafter—this view of the matter is here accepted.
When one comes to argue it, to produce the primitive facts
is, of course, impossible. It must even be admitted that
such evidence as we have amongst the few facts collected of
late years concerning ancient races of men, gives the earlier
date to animistic ideas; for if some of the cave-paintings
of Aurignacian origin, in which, for example, wild cattle are
shown pierced with arrows, may be interpreted as of magical
significance; on the other hand, the burial at Le Moustier,
still more ancient, shows a regard for the corpse, in the
disposal of it and in the things left with it, such as usually
goes with the ghost-theory. These discoveries take us back
some thousands of years before Menes; but probably leave
us far from the beginning of human ideas concerning the
supernatural.</p>

<p>If Magic preceded Animism, we must insert a stage of
thought at the beginning of Comte’s series, making four
instead of three; and the suggestion may perhaps be made to
appear plausible, that the Metaphysical stage, the reign of
occult forces in explanation, is not a mere residue of Fetichism
after the spirit has departed, but rather the re-emergence
into daylight of magical ideas of force, that always persisted,
but for ages were kept in comparative obscurity by the
vogue of Animism.</p>


<h3><a id="ch04_02"></a>§ 2. What is Magic?</h3>

<p>In his <cite>Development of Moral Ideas</cite> (<abbr class="no-it" title="2">II.</abbr> 47) Prof. Westermarck
observes that savages distinguish two classes of phenomena;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the natural or familiar, and the supernatural or mysterious.
The latter again are divided into the mechanical (Magic)
and the volitional (Animism). This seems to be true: it
corrects the notion, still common, that the savage explains
all natural activities by Animism; recognises that he takes
some phenomena as a matter of course, as the animals do;
and, as to events that are not a matter of course, rightly
marks the distinction between his conceptions of them as
either mechanical (due to some uniformly acting force) or
volitional (that is, arbitrary or capricious). With the savage,
then, there are ongoings of things around him that are <em>perceived</em>
to be regular and continuous; and there are others
between which connections are <em>imagined</em> to take place, and
these either regularly or capriciously: for thus I venture to
interpret the difference between the natural and the supernatural;
it is the difference between perception-belief and
imagination-belief. Common sense, Magic, Animism—these
are the three great congeries of ideas that compete for the
control of his thoughts and in his interpretation of the world.</p>

<p>Magic may be defined as a connexion of events imagined
to be constant and to depend upon the agency of some thing
or activity possessing an efficacious quality or force (in fact
unreal), and not to depend (as a connexion) upon the will of
any particular person.</p>

<p>Whether Magic is ever wrought by the bare wish or will
of a human being will be discussed below (§ 6). Here, the
proviso that a magical connexion does not depend upon the
will of a person, is meant to exclude Animism. For pure
Animism involves the belief that a ghost, spirit, or god
(though he may work by Magic) can produce an effect by his
direct action, without using any visible or invisible means
other than his own spiritual body and force. This is not what
a magician does: he works by means of a connexion of
events known (so he thinks) to himself and often to others.
The magical implement (talisman or spell) that he uses has
qualities that are magical facts, just as the qualities of his
spear are physical facts. He can make a stone spear-head
by means of another stone; and he may be able to make a
talisman by means of a spell; but the powers of the talisman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
or of the spell are their own; he cannot create Magic, but
only discover and use it. Whether he shall use it, depends
upon his choice; but its powers do not; they are inherent,
like physical forces. Faust can conjure the devil; but so
can Wagner, if he knows the spell: the power of the spell is
indifferent to the conjuror. A man may, indeed, be a source
of magical power because he is a chief, or has the evil eye,
or is taboo for unpurged homicide; but these things do not
depend upon his will; he is in the same class with impersonal
things that are magical.</p>

<p>A rule of Magic, as describing a uniform connexion of
events, resembles what we call a law of nature; and further
in this, that it is not supposed to be absolute or unconditional,
but a tendency, subject to counteraction by hostile
Magic or (perhaps) by demonic force. But it differs from
a law of nature in being wholly imaginary and incapable of
verification.</p>

<p>To practise Magic is to use some such rule in order to obtain
an end desired. This can be attempted by any man, so far
as his knowledge reaches; and the greater his knowledge the
greater his power, provided he have the courage to act upon
it. All stages of proficiency may be traced from the simple
layman who swings a bull-roarer to raise the wind, to the
wizard who lives by his art, and is feared by all his tribe and
far beyond it, or to the erudite magician who controls the
demons and vies with the gods.</p>

<p>Magical things, objects or actions, in their simplest forms,
are charms, spells and rites; and since the ends for which
they can be used are either to protect oneself or to exert
power over other persons or things, each of these kinds of
magic-thing may be defensive or offensive. A defensive
charm is called an amulet; an offensive charm is a talisman.
For a defensive spell (say, against sickness or accident) there
is, I believe, no appropriate name; offensive spells (say, to
control the weather or to curse an enemy) may be called
incantations (but the usage is not fixed). Rites (that is,
any magic actions that are not spells) may also be defensive
(as to touch wood), or offensive (as to point at a man); but
we have no names for these different intentions. From these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
simplest beginnings the whole learning and mystery of Magic
seems to have developed.</p>


<h3><a id="ch04_03"></a>§ 3. The Beginnings of Magic</h3>

<p>The quest of origins is fascinating, because, if successful,
it will help us to frame that outline of the history of the
world which the philosophic mind regards as a necessary
of life. To discuss the beginnings of Magic must necessarily
be, in some measure, a speculative undertaking; because
the facts are lost. If Magic was practised in the Aurignacian
culture (say) 20,000 years ago, how can we get to the back
of it? But speculation is not guess-work, if we always keep
in view such facts as we have; if we are careful to give
notice whenever the facts fail us; if we guide ourselves by
scientific principles; and if we make no assumptions merely
to suit our case, but only such as are generally admitted in
all departments. For example:</p>

<p>(1) We may reasonably assume that the simplest magical
beliefs and practices are of the earliest type: and nothing
can be simpler than the belief in charms, rites and spells.
It is, indeed, difficult to find many of these practices—though
some can be produced—in their simplest forms in our records
of backward peoples; partly because they have not been
enough observed; partly because Magic is apt everywhere to
become saturated with Animism; partly because charms,
rites and spells are generally, for greater efficacy, compounded
with one another. But these considerations do not affect
the simplicity of the idea involved in the magical beliefs;
which is merely this, that a certain object by its presence,
or that an action, or an utterance, by merely entering into
the course of events, will serve our purpose. A bare uniformity
of connexion—if <i>A</i>, then <i>B</i>—in accordance with the familiar
ongoings of Nature and our common activities, is all that is
assumed. Many kinds of obstacles stop an arrow or a dart;
carrion collects the vultures: so a patterned comb in one’s
hair stops the demon of disease; a patterned quiver, or a
certain song, brings the monkeys down from the tree-tops.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
A spell assumes merely that certain objects, or animals, or
spirits, must always comply with a wish or command expressed
in words, just as another human being often does. It is their
supposed uniform coerciveness that makes the words magical.
If any form of words ever seems to have been successful, it
must be repeated; because to have the same effect the action
must be the same. Immersed in an indefinite mass of experiences,
the postulate that we call “cause and effect” (unformulated,
of course) underlies every action, and therefore
underlies Magic; it is the ground of all expectation and of all
confidence.</p>

<p>(2) The types of Magic that are the most prevalent are
probably the earliest; and these are charms, rites and spells.
They are found not only amongst savages, but the world
over: even in civilised countries most of the uneducated,
many of the half-educated, and not a few of those who have
“finished their education,” employ them; whereas more
complicated magical practices, except such as have been
taken up into religious celebrations, are apt to fall into
desuetude. What is universal must be adapted to very
simple conditions of existence; these beliefs, therefore, to
mental wants and proclivities that are probably primitive;
and what conditions can be more simple, or more primitive,
or more universal than ignorance of our fate and eagerness to
clutch at anything that may give us confidence.</p>

<p>And not only are charms, rites and spells in all ages and
everywhere employed in their simplest forms; but analysis
of the most elaborate ritual and of nominally animistic
practices will discover the same beliefs at the bottom of them.
The idea of the amulet or the talisman is found in fetiches,
beads, praying-wheels, and equally in a long mimetic dance or
a passion-play; whose central purpose always is to avert
some evil or to secure some good—success in hunting, or war,
or agriculture. Similarly, the spell is involved in all rites,
so far as verbal formulæ are used in them; and in all curses
or prayers, so far as their efficacy depends upon a sound form
of words.</p>

<p>The persistence of magical beliefs amongst civilised people
is, in some measure, due to tradition; though the tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
could not continue effective if there were not in every generation
a predisposition to accept it; and how far it is due to
tradition, how far to a spontaneous proclivity, in any one
who is inclined to believe in charms, rites and spells, he
himself must judge as best he can. Superstition having been
at one time extremely useful socially, there is some presumption
that tribes addicted to it (within limits) had an advantage,
and that the disposition became hereditary. It is a recent
acquisition compared with the love of climbing; but once
ingrained, it must remain till disutility breeds it out. Meanwhile,
it is a stain on the human soul. So much of one’s
early life is always forgotten that no one can be sure that he
was not inoculated with such notions in childhood; especially
when we consider that religious practices, taught before they
can be well understood, must often wear a magical habit to
a child; and that medicines, whose operations nobody used
to understand, were on the same foot with Magic. For my
own part, bating the last considerations, I cannot remember
ever to have heard in childhood any sort of Magic spoken of
except with amusement; yet magical beliefs have always
haunted me. With Animism it was otherwise. When six
or seven years old, I was told by a nursemaid—a convinced
adherent of one of the many little sects that have ramified
out of Wesleyanism in Cornwall—the most appalling ghost-stories;
and these stories, exciting no doubt an ancient
disposition, and reinforced by a visualising faculty that
nightly peopled the darkness with innumerable spectres,
entirely overpowered the teachings of those whom there was
better reason to trust, that ghosts are a superstition from
which true religion has for ever set us free. The effects
lasted into middle age. Andrew Lang said of ghosts that
“he did not believe, but he trembled”; and that precisely
describes my own state of mind for many years. Now, as
to Magic, my impression is that had it been suggested to me
in a serious way, and not merely by casual allusions to “luck,”
the experience would have stuck in my memory. The first
time that I can remember practising rites, I was between ten
and eleven years old, living at a small boarding-school. To
keep off a dreaded event, I used to go every morning to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
pump, fill my mouth with water and spurt it out in a violent
stream—three times. This went on for some weeks. To
the best of my recollection, the impulse was spontaneous,
and I cannot remember why the particular rite was adopted:
to spout water out of the mouth may have been symbolic of a
pushing away of what was feared; but I do not think I was
conscious of that meaning. Nothing further of the kind
recurs to me until about the age of fifteen, when, at another
school, the master-passion of my life was cricket; and I
always practised some rite before going on the field, and
carried a charm in my pocket; but I cannot recall what they
were. At present, a day rarely passes without my experiencing
some impulse to practise Magic. In lighting my first
pipe in the morning (for example), if I remember how I lit
it, where I struck the match, etc., yesterday, and if no misfortune
has happened since, I feel an unmistakable impulse
to “light up” again in the same way. No reason is distinctly
present to me for acting so, and therefore it is hazardous to
analyse the attitude; but it is not merely incipient habit:
to the best of my judgment it is this, that such a way of
lighting my pipe was one amongst the antecedents of a quiet
time, and that it will be well to reinstate as many of them
as possible. It is more comfortable to do it than to alter
it: one feels more confident.</p>

<p>Inquiry amongst my friends shows that some have similar
experiences, and others (both men and women) have not. A
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">questionnaire</i> on such a point might be useful; but difficult to
arrange without giving suggestion or exciting bias.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>(3) There are causes originating the belief in charms, rites
and spells so simple that nothing could be more natural to
the primitive human mind. What is more universally powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in producing belief in the connexion of events, and consequent
expectancy of repetition, than an interesting coincidence?
If, says Sir E.&nbsp;F. im Thurn,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> a Carib sees a rock in
any way abnormal or curious, and if shortly afterwards any
evil happens to him, he regards rock and evil as cause and
effect, and perceives in the rock a spirit. This is animistic;
but the same tendency to be impressed by coincidence underlies
Magic. For example: A hunting party of Esquimos met
with no game. One of them went back to the sledges and
got the ham-bone of a dog to eat. Returning with this in
his hand, he met and killed a seal. Ever afterwards he
carried a ham-bone in his hand when hunting.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The ham-bone
had become a talisman. Such a mental state as the
Esquimo’s used to be ascribed to the association of ideas;
but it is better to consider it as an empirical judgment.
Other circumstances of the event may have been associated
in his mind; but as to the ham-bone and the kill, he thinks
of them together, and judges that they are connected. Then,
having judged that the ham-bone influenced the kill, he carries
it with him in future in order to repeat the conditions of
success.</p>

<p>We may perhaps discern the moment when Magic first
fastened upon the human mind by considering how the use
of weapons and snares by the primitive hunter impaired his
sense of the mechanical continuity of the work. In a struggle
with prey body to body, success or failure was thoroughly
understood; but with the use of weapons and snares it became
conditional upon the quality of these aids and upon his skill
with them: more and more conditional as the number of
steps increased between the first preparation and the event;
at any one of which unforeseen occurrences might frustrate
his plans. Hence an irresistible desire to strengthen and
insure every step of his task; and to gratify this desire Magic
arose.</p>

<p>That Magic should depend upon the assumption that
“things connected in thought are connected in fact” seems
unintelligible, until we consider that the thought in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
they are connected is a judgment concerning the facts. But
how is it possible to judge so foolishly? Absurd association
is intelligible; it cannot be helped; but judgment is not a
passive process. Well: a logician might interpret the case
as a fallacy in applying the inductive canons: the Esquimo
had two instances: (<i>a</i>) no ham-bone, no seal; (<i>b</i>) ham-bone,
seal: or, again, into the circumstances of his expedition he
introduced a ham-bone, and the seal followed. Therefore,
the carrying of a ham-bone was the cause of getting a seal.
He had not read Mill, and did not know what precautions
should be taken before adopting such conclusions. The
mind must have begun in this way; and after many thousands
of years, the opportunities of error in empirical judgment
began to be appreciated, and the canons were formulated.
The experience of every man at every stage of life, personal
or social (probably evoking an inherited disposition), continually
impresses him with the belief in some connexion of
antecedent and consequent, that each event arises out of
others. But what it is in the antecedent that determines
the event can never, in practical affairs, be exactly known.
In definite cases, where method is applicable, we may analyse
the consequent into the tendencies of forces in amount and
direction; or we may sometimes reproduce it by an experiment
exactly controlled. But where these resources fail us,
as they often do in practical affairs, we are little confident of
grasping all, or even the chief conditions of any event that
interests us. The savage knows nothing of method, and,
therefore, feels less distrust. He learns something of the
conditions of success in hunting; this is biologically necessary
to him as it is to a tiger; only those survive that learn
them. He knows that he must have weapons as efficient
as possible, must go to the habitat of his prey, must not be
heard, or seen, or smelt. But with all precautions he sometimes
fails; therefore there must be some other condition
which he does not understand. Hence anything observed,
or any word or action, that happens to be followed by success,
may have been a means to that success.</p>

<p>And if it once has been, it always will be: not that he
thinks of it in this general way. But even animals, as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as they have learnt a sequence, trust to it. Dogs and cats
learn faster than guinea-pigs; monkeys faster than dogs and
cats; man quicker still. But in no case would there be any
use in learning, if it did not lead to action as if the experience
had been generalised. There is no mystery in generalisation;
it is spontaneous, and only waits for language to
express itself; the difficult thing to acquire is caution. In
default of method, the only test of truth is relative constancy
in experience—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per enumerationem simplicem</i>—faulty but
broadly effective; which requires time and practice. Primitive
Magic is an incautious, unexpressed generalisation;
and the conditions are such that the error cannot be easily
detected. As long as a savage follows the instinctive, traditionary
and acquired knowledge that he has of hunting,
practices based on wrong judgments, but not interfering
with the traditionary art, such as the carrying about of a
bone, or a crystal, or having a special pattern on his quiver,
cannot impair his success; may add to it by increasing his
confidence: so that as long as success lasts there is nothing
to suggest the falsity of the judgment. A series of failures
may make the hunter throw away his talisman, or (at a later
stage of Magic) take it to a medicine-man to be redoctored.
How many thousands of times may Magic have begun in
this way and lost its hold again, before the human mind
became chronically infected with it!</p>

<p>Similarly with amulets, anything unusual that a man
happens to have about him, when attacked by a leopard or
snake, from which he escapes, may be kept as a safeguard
against future perils. And with rites: any gesture or action,
however irrelevant, that happens to precede a successful
effort, may be repeated in order to reinstate all the antecedents
of success. So, too, with the origin of spells. It is a
common impulse, and quite spontaneous, to accompany an
action with words, incentive or expletive. If a hunter does
so in driving home his spear successfully, he will next time
repeat the words: they then become a spell.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> First, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
there are practices of carrying about charms, repeating words,
repeating actions; next, along with these practices, beliefs
grow up as to the nature of their efficacy, their virtue; and
much later it is discovered that some of the practices seem
to involve certain common principles which the savage had
never thought of.</p>

<p>In trying to imagine ourselves in the place of such a man,
we must not omit the emotional excitement that determines
his judgment. It is the intensity of his desire for success,
his anxiety about it, that makes him snatch at, and cling to,
whatever may possibly be a means to it: he does not see
how it acts, but will take no risks by omitting it. Since what
is true of primitive hunting is true of all undertakings—that
we know some conditions of success but far from all—and
since we are all of us frequently in this position—the wonder is
that we resort so little to Magic. That many people do so in
London is notorious.</p>


<h3><a id="ch04_04"></a>§ 4. Magical Force and Primitive Ideas of Causation</h3>

<p>Magic is a uniform connexion of events, depending on
some impersonal force that has no real existence. What
causes make men believe in such force? In the first place,
everything is necessarily conceived of by everybody (and
probably in some dim way by the higher animals) as a centre
of forces. Its weight, when we try to lift it; inertia, when
we push it, or when it is moving and we try to stop it; degree
of hardness, when we strike or grasp it; elasticity, when the
bent bough of a tree recoils; the sway of torrents and the
lift of waves; falling trees, avalanches, water-spouts, hurricanes:
all these things a man must think of, as he does of
other men and animals, in comparison with his own strength
or impotence. Into their actions and reactions he reads such
tension and effort as he himself feels in struggling with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
or in grappling one of his own hands with the other; and as
their action is full of surprises he does not suppose himself
to know all that they can do.</p>

<p>But, further, the strain exhibited by some objects, especially
trees; the noises they make, creaking and groaning in the
wind; the shrieking and moaning of the wind itself, the
threatening and whispering of the sea, thunder and the roar
of torrents: all excite <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Einfühlung</i> or empathy, illusory
sympathy with things that do not feel. Their voices, more
than anything else, I believe, endow them for our imaginations
with an inward life, which Mr. Marett has well called
Animatism,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and which must not be confounded with the
Animism that used to be attributed to all children and all
savages—the belief that every object is actuated by a spirit,
or even that it has a consciousness like our own. What
truth there was in that doctrine is fully covered by Animatism.</p>

<p>Again, the savage is acquainted with invisible forces some
of which seem to act at a distance. The wind is the great
type of invisible force; heat, sound, odour are also invisible,
and act at a distance; the light of the camp-fire acts at a
distance, spreading across the prairie or into the recesses of
the forest; and lightnings issue from the clouds. In dreams,
one visits some remote hunting-ground and returns instantly;
distance and time are distorted or annihilated; and if you
can act where you dream, why not where you intensely
imagine yourself?</p>

<p>Hence there are abundant analogues in experience by
which the savage can conceive of his talisman as a force-thing
that acts invisibly and acts at a distance. Australian medicine-men
“threw their joïas (evil magic) invisibly, ‘like the
wind,’ as they said.”<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The talisman acts at a distance, like
a missile; it acts for the person who owns it as his spear
does, and is dangerous to others who have not practised
with it. Sometimes, indeed, magic things have no owners,
and are dangerous to everybody: malignant influence radiating
from them, like the heat of a fire or the stench of a corpse.
Such are two stones described by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
as marking the place where an old man and two women died
for breaking a marriage-taboo. “They are so full of evil
magic that if any but old men go near, it kills them. Now
and then a very old man goes and throws stones and bushes
upon the spot to keep down the evil magic.” It is as if one
covered up a fire or a corpse. And, further, magical force
may exist in a diffused way, like darkness, heat, cold, epidemic
disease, tribal unrest, without necessarily attaching to any
particular thing. In the Western Isles of Torres Straits<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
mishaps may be signs of an unlucky state of things in general.
A fisherman, usually successful, having once failed at his
task, was depressed; but on two women dying in his village
soon after, he was consoled; since this showed that failure
was not his fault. Currents of this magical force, favourable
or unfavourable to things in general, may be seen in the flow
and ebb of the tide, the waxing and waning of the moon,
and in the course of the seasons. From this way of thinking
it is but a step to the conception of <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">mana</i>, as it is called in
Melanesia:<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">orenda</i> of the Iroquois, <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">manitou</i> of the Algonquin,
<i lang="und" xml:lang="und">wakanda</i> of the Omaha.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> It is the power of the wonderful
and mysterious in the world, which becomes especially manifest
in Magic and in the agency of spirits. Similar notions
are found in many regions at various stages of culture, but
nowhere (I believe) at the lowest stages; so that it is unreasonable
to treat it as the first source of ideas of the supernatural.
It is too comprehensive a generalisation to find expression
amongst savages. The Arunta have got as far as the generalisation
of evil Magic under the name of <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">arungquiltha</i>.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> But
<i lang="und" xml:lang="und">mana</i> is a generalisation of all the imaginary forces of superstition,
vague and mysterious; as “cause,” in popular use, is
a generalisation of all the supposed “forces” of nature.</p>

<p>Rites also act at a distance by invisible force; for this power
belongs to gesture-language, and the simplest rites are
gestures. And so do spells; for wishes, commands, threats
expressed in words, act upon men at a distance by invisible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
force; and spells are nothing but such expressions conceived
of in a particular way, as having that uniform efficacity which
is Magic. Spells, being thought of as forces, are reified;
so that blessings or curses cling to their objects like garlands,
or like contaminating rags.</p>

<p>Magical force, then, is a notion derived from experience
of natural forces and employed to account for events that are
unusual, wonderful, mysterious, not to be interpreted by
that common sense which is the cumulative result of usual
occurrences. It is superimposed upon the older and wider
presumption of causation, and is expected to manifest itself
with the same uniformity; so that, if the laws of it can be
discovered, it supplies a basis for the Art of Magic. So far
is Magic from being the source of the belief in causation!
But I have spoken of the “older and wider <em>presumption</em> of
causation”; for (as has been shown) the definite postulate
that all the ongoings of the world may be analysed upon the
principal of cause and effect, can never come into the minds
of primitive men; and even to ourselves it rarely occurs,
except in scientific discussions or logical exercises; but we
always act as if we trusted in it, and so does a savage, and
so does a dog. The presumption is reinforced by every
moment’s ordinary experience; and without it no consistency
of life is possible. This ungeneralised presumption determines
all thoughts and actions, mechanical, animistic, or
magical. That the forces implied in superstition are generalised
in such concepts as <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">mana</i> before the principle of causation
obtains expression, is due to the prepotency of the unusual,
wonderful, mysterious in attracting attention.</p>

<p>In our modern analysis of mechanical causation there are
four requirements: (1) every event has a cause; (2) causation
is uniform; (3) the cause is the assemblage of the indispensable
conditions of the effect (and no others); (4) the cause is
proportional to the effect. In the savage’s mind these requirements
are also obscurely recognised: (1) he seeks a cause for
everything: (2) he expects it to act uniformly: (3) he believes
in reinstating all the conditions of the effect, as appears from
his preparations for hunting, or war, or marriage, or whatever
he may have in hand; but he is much more ignorant than
we are as to what conditions are indispensable and decisive:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
(4) he knows vaguely that the cause is proportional to the
effect; for (<i>a</i>) he succeeds in making effective weapons,
etc., by mechanical means; (<i>b</i>) he is very susceptible to the
“size-weight illusion,” twice as much as we are,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and this
implies the adjustment of effort to a supposed weight; (<i>c</i>) he
repeats a spell in order to strengthen it, or unites a talisman,
a rite and a spell in one assault, implying that greater force
must be directed against greater resistance; and so on.</p>

<p>Causation, then, is universally assumed: how do Animism
and Magic influence the latent conception? As to Animism,
(1) it palters with the uniformity of causation; for though
the ghost or spirit acts from human motives, no one knows
exactly what its motives are. It may be cajoled, implored,
even threatened; but the result does not always answer
desire: there is apparent caprice or free will, with consequent
loss of confidence, and an uncomfortable feeling that leads
to a reaction in favour of controlling the god, or ghost, by
Magic. (2) The ghost is at first merely a man-force disengaged
from the visible body, but still having its own body
through which it can produce various effects. But the fear
of a ghost immediately endows it with superhuman power;
and in course of time it becomes more and more powerful,
even to omnipotence; so that it can of itself bring about any
event; and, therefore, the “assemblage of conditions”
becomes unnecessary to causation: there need be no visible
conditions: miracles occur; creation out of nothing is
possible. (3) For such a power the “proportionality of
cause and effect” becomes almost meaningless; but not
quite, for there are degrees of spirit-force; and what one
cannot do a stronger can.</p>

<p>As to Magic, it has the great merit of (1) preserving the
uniformity of causation. But (2) it vitiates the presumption
of causation by including in the total antecedent unreal
conditions, namely, the forces of rites and spells; and by
generating a frame of mind that makes it impossible to
eliminate them. The hunter uses all the resources of his
art in hunting; he also practises rites and spells. To which
does he owe his success? We might suggest that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
try the hunting without the rites; but he is afraid to; and
should he try, his positivism would probably break down at
the first failure to kill. Well, then, let him try the rites without
the hunting; but he is not such a fool: and, if he were,
the medicine-man would tell him that, of course, he must
“use the means.” (3) Magic impairs the sense of proportionality
between cause and effect, by recognising antecedents
which are, in their nature, immeasurable. In their admirable
work, <cite>The Pagan Tribes of Borneo</cite>, Messrs. Hose and McDougall
remark<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> that it is sometimes said, that people of lowly culture
have “no conception of mechanical causation, and that every
material object is regarded by them as animated”; but they
do not think that this could be truthfully said about any
of the peoples of Borneo. In the construction of houses,
boats, weapons, traps, they have a nice appreciation of the
principles involved. Yet we find<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> that these skilled artisans
believe that they can retard an enemy’s boat by hanging under
one of its benches a quartz pebble. Similarly, the Boloki
of the Congo, having made a good canoe, before launching,
strike it on the stern with an axe “to take away the weight.”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
And the Fijians, still better boat-builders, believe that to put
a basket of bitter oranges on a canoe reduces its speed.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Inasmuch as the possibility of action at a distance is still
in debate, the savage cannot perhaps upon that tenet be
confidently corrected.</p>

<p>If there is any truth in the foregoing account of the latent
ideas, or presumptions, of savages concerning causation, it is
plain that Magic (and likewise Animism) did not help, but
hindered the development of these ideas. Notwithstanding
(or, perhaps, because of) certain specious resemblances to
science, Magic is, and always has been, the enemy of science.</p>


<h3><a id="ch04_05"></a>§ 5. Magic and Mystery</h3>

<p>Magic begins with ignorance of some of the conditions of a
desired event, and the adoption (on account of coincidence)
of anything that fixes one’s attention as contributing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
total antecedent. As the supposed conditions of events grow
more and more miscellaneous, the disposition increases to
regard anything as a possible cause of anything else. Hence
unbounded suspicion whenever an interesting event occurs
whose antecedents are not familiar and manifest. The more
unusual any occurrence, the more it must excite attention
and be apt to arouse suspicion; and the first arrival of
travellers or missionaries amongst a wild tribe is an event
so unprecedented, that it is likely enough to occasion exaggerated
suspicions and behaviour which, when reported,
misrepresent the tribe’s normal attitude of mind. For this
allowance should be made.</p>

<p>However, in Magic the causation is never traceable; therefore
it becomes mysterious. The sense of mystery arises
when something excites wonder, wonder gives place to
curiosity, curiosity is baffled, and wonder returns with fear.
The magical power of an inert object, such as a black pebble
or a shark’s tooth, or of a bone that is pointed towards a
victim, or of a spear that is swung but not thrown, and nevertheless
inflicts a wound, though an invisible one, is something
unknown, or mysterious. That is to say, it is a merely
imagined action which remains obscure and inscrutable, in
comparison with the perceived action of a spear thrown at
a deer and slaying it with a visible wound. The savage
has adequate practical knowledge of the latter process; of
the former only a vague analogical image. He feels the
difference, and that the Magic is mysterious; and mystery,
being common to all magical processes, and deeply impressive
(especially in black Magic), becomes what we call a “fundamental
attribute” of Magic, pervading the whole apperceptive
mass that is formed by a man’s magic-beliefs. Therefore
whatever excites the sense of mystery tends to be assimilated<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
by this apperceptive mass and confirmed as magical;
just as the mass of our scientific knowledge assimilates and
confirms any proposition that has the attributes of a scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
law. Hence the savage accepts the mysterious remedies of
an European doctor as magical; and he is ready to regard as
magical, and to fear, anything—a rock, tree, or water-spout—that
by any trait excites his sense of mystery. Magic,
then, does not arise from mystery; but having come into
existence, it appeals to the feeling of mystery; and then
whatever else is mysterious tends to become magical.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Magic being mysterious, the more mysterious the more
powerful it must be. Hence foreign Magic is more dreaded
than the home-made; ancient Magic is more powerful than
modern; muttered spells, or formulæ in a strange language,
or in one whose meaning has been lost, are more efficacious
than intelligible speech; written characters and numbers
have a subduing prestige; verse is more subtle than prose
(for poets are everywhere respected); a wizard is more impressive
in a mask than when bare-faced, in a fit than when sober;
and operations in the dark, that ought to excite scepticism,
enhance credulity.</p>

<p>Masses of ideas having this mysterious quality form relatively
dissociated systems, which offer resistance to all ideas
that want it, and therefore to what we call “explanation.”
Hence the conservative, inexpugnable character of Magic
and its easy alliance with Mysticism. Resistance to explanation
may go the length of denying present experience; as
when a man is seen to be slain by a weapon or by a falling
tree, and yet his death is ascribed to sorcery: the fear of
sorcery having become a fixed idea.</p>


<h3><a id="ch04_06"></a>§ 6. Volitional Magic</h3>

<p>Magical power inheres in things, rites and spells without
regard to the man who uses them; they may be sold or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
taught, and then serve the new possessor. But much the
greater part of all known magical operation depends upon
the agency of some person, man or spirit, who sets it going;
and rites and spells are from the first, by their nature, personal
actions.</p>

<p>In the later stages of Magic, no doubt, it is held that a
mere wish or volition may be efficacious: in Cornwall they
still tell you, when you are cold or tired, that you “look
wisht,” that is, as if you had been ill-wisht and were pining
away (this meaning is generally forgotten). But it seems to
me improbable that such an idea should be primitive. People
who, in inflicting penalties, do not discriminate between accidental
and intentional offences, cannot be supposed to ascribe
power to a mental process as such; and I have not been
able to find in reports of very backward tribes any case of
wish-magic unsupported by magical implements. Dr. Haddon
says<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> that, among the eastern islanders of Torres Straits,
the power of words and the projection of the will are greatly
believed in. A youth who makes love procures a piece of
black lava shaped significantly, and anoints it with coco-nut
oil, etc.; he also anoints his own temples, and thinks as
intently as possible about the girl, and repeats a spell whenever
he sees her, using the names of Sagaro and Pikaro, wife
and mistress of the hero Sida. Now, with this complex
apparatus of talisman, rite and spell, how much is left to
wishing or the projection of the will? He thinks hard about
the girl, no doubt; but that needs no voluntary effort: at
least, in this climate, voluntary effort is soon exhausted in
trying to think of anything else. Mr. Weeks, in his book
<cite>Among Congo Cannibals</cite>, describing a people of somewhat
higher culture, and much more advanced Animism than the
natives of Torres Straits, explains the nervousness in the
poison ordeal even of those who are innocent of any nefarious
practices, by asking—“For who has not at some time wished
another’s death?”—and by the admitted doctrine that a
man may be full of evil magic without knowing it. From
this it seems to be inferable that a mere wish may be effective.
But not justly; for a man full of evil magic is an incarnate
talisman; and such a man may operate without wishing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
as often happens with the evil-eye. At any rate, these casual
Congo wishes do not amount to volition; the faintest velleity
is enough for the hair-trigger of such explosive personalities.
In Japan, too, the angry spirit of a living person may inflict
a curse unknown to himself.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Still, with the progress of Magic, deliberate wishes may
acquire independent power. A man practising evil Magic,
and desiring secrecy, has a strong motive to believe (that
is, there is a cause of his believing) that his tacit wish has the
power of invisible action at a distance; and the way by which
he arrives at that belief is quite clear: for a spell is a magical
force; it is also an expressed wish or command; and, if
muttered, is more rather than less powerful than when uttered
aloud. Why not, then, “sub-muttered,” or merely thought?</p>

<p>From this degenerate notion of will-work we must distinguish
the personal power of an accomplished wizard in his
whole magical activity. Whatever a man does with a talisman
or a spell, as it were with a tool or a weapon, may be
done with more or less concentration of energy and proficiency
in the performance; and one man will be plainly
superior to another. Success depends upon doing one’s
best; therefore upon the will. And Magic often needs
courage and resource; but in the development of the art it
depends still more upon knowledge; wherein the magician
is wont to boast himself. For wizardry is the most reputable
faculty of primitive scholarship: to know all spells and rites,
the arts of divination and medicine, the ancestry and true
name of all dangerous things, which gives control over them:
and it is a universal belief that knowledge is power.</p>


<h3><a id="ch04_07"></a>§ 7. The Evolution of Magic—Direct Magic</h3>

<p>From the simple beginnings thus described, Magic, like
everything else in the world, proceeds to grow and differentiate.
It grows by the lengthening of spells from the
briefest wish or command to many verses;<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> by the extension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of rites from the waving of a bough to raise the wind to the
Australian Intichiuma ceremonies that go on for many days;
by the accumulating of charms by the bagful; by the compounding
of rites with spells, and by repetition of them
three times or some other sacred number. It differentiates
by being applied and adapted to more and more purposes:
from hunting (if we suppose it to begin there) to war and
love; to birth, marriage and death; to the giving of diseases
and the curing of them; to the protection of property and
to the discovery (or concealment) of theft; to navigation,
building, agriculture, the care of flocks and herds, the procuring
of rain, renewing the vigour of the sun and binding the
influence of the Pleiades. At the same time Magic, originally
practised (we may presume) by individuals, comes to engage
the concern and co-operation of families, clans and tribes;
and a distinction grows up between what we call “white”
and “black” Magic: practices that are for the welfare of
the tribe, or of some portion of it, and practices designed to
gratify private passions without regard to their effect upon
the community.</p>

<p>One may notice certain stages (not always serial) in the
development of Magic: First, the simple and direct defence
of oneself or fellows against other persons or things, storms,
diseases, etc.; or, again, direct attack upon such hostile
powers—by means of charms, spells or rites. Secondly,
indirect or dramatic Magic, operating not upon persons or
things themselves, but (expecting the same effect) upon
imitations of them, or upon detached parts or appurtenances;
as in the well-known device of making a waxen figure of a
man and melting it in the fire to his destruction. Thirdly,
the alliance of Magic with Animism, leading to sorcery,
exorcism and ceremonies associated with Religion—discussed
below in the sixth and seventh chapters. Fourthly, the confusion
of Magic with Science, as in Astrology and Alchemy—referred
to in the seventh and tenth chapters.</p>

<p>Direct magical rites begin in very simple ways, probably
with gestures: as to point at a man in threatening; to throw
out the open hand in warding off evil; to claw the air behind
a man’s back, as Australian women do. It becomes more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and more elaborate as the result of much study devoted to
a matter of supreme interest: especially after the rise of a
professional class of medicine-men, with whom inventions
accumulate and become traditionary. Similarly, spells are
at first merely wishes, or commands, or warnings. An
Australian Wind-doctor cries, “Let the west wind be
bound.”<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The southern Massim of New Guinea have a spell
to open a cave—“O rock, be cleft!” and, again, to shut the
cave—“O rock, be closed!”<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Nothing can be simpler.
How spells rise into poetry and are combined with rites and
charms is shown by a Polynesian example: a man being ill
with consumption, which is called <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">Moomoo</i>, a medicine-man
is sent for. He comes, sits by the patient, and <span class="nobreak">sings—</span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">“O Moomoo, O Moomoo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m on the eve of spearing you.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Then, rising, he flourishes his spear over the patient’s head,
and goes away. No one dares speak or smile.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>As to charms, the simplest, and perhaps the earliest, are
small pebbles, such as the Australian “bulks,” or crystals.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> In
Papua there are quartz charms so powerful that it is not safe for
even the owner to touch them. In that country the qualities
that make a thing suitable for a charm are: (1) similarity in
contour, or in other ways, to the object to be influenced;
(2) rarity; (3) unusual shape in not very uncommon objects:<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
in short, whatever arrests attention. Dr. Codrington says:
“A stone takes a man’s fancy; it is like something, clearly
not a common stone; there must be <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">mana</i> in it: puts it in
his garden; and a good crop proves he was right.”<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Among
the Esquimo, strange or curious objects never before seen
are sometimes considered to bring success to the finder;
and charms are carried shaped like the animals hunted.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Such a taste is very ancient, if the same purpose was served
by those animal-shaped stones, retouched to increase the
resemblance, which have been found in considerable numbers
in France and England.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> In the bag of a West African sorcerer
may be seen a bit of leopard skin, of snake’s skin, hawk’s
talons, bone of a dead man, leaves of certain plants, etc.;
each having its own virtue, and uniting their powers in the
interest of the formidable owner. The <cite>Chanson de Roland</cite>
describes a talisman to which the chief of Charlemagne’s
peers must have owed no small part of his prowess—his
famous sword:—</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">“Ah! Durendal, most holy, fair indeed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relics enough thy golden hilt conceals:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Peter’s Tooth, the Blood of Saint Basile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of the Hairs of my lord, Saint Denise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of the Robe, was worn by Saint Mary.”<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">I cannot call it fair fighting, and wonder that, thus armed,
he should ever have been mortally wounded by the miscreant
hordes of Mahum and Tervagant, however numerous.</p>

<p>An influential outgrowth of primitive Magic is the taboo.
Taboo is the dangerousness of a person, or thing, or action,
or word, conceived of as a motive for not touching or uttering
or meddling therewith. The dangerousness may either lie
in the nature of a person or thing, or be imposed upon it.
A chief, for example, and everything belonging to him, is
generally taboo by inherent sacredness: he is, like Mr.
Weeks’s Congolese, full of evil magic. The idea of the talisman
has thus been extended to include certain men. In
many tribes it includes all women; but since to make them
always taboo is too much for human nature, they are treated
as such only periodically, or when a man is about to be
exposed to some further danger, which will be the more likely
to injure him when already contaminated by evil magic.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
This is very clear in a case reported by Prof. Seligman:<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
at Yam warriors were forbidden to sleep with their wives
before battle; else “bow and arrow belong other fellow he
smell you, he shoot you, you no got luck.” Still, physical
consequences (which may explain the superstition) are also
considered: a diver for pearl-shell must similarly abstain;
because, else, “man he sleepy.” The continence required of
women to ensure the safety of their husbands when away at
war or hunting may be due to a belief in a “sympathy”
or “participation,” as if husband and wife were in some
mysterious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapport</i>; but, deeper, there may have been a
fetch of policy. When magical taboos are generally recognised
and feared, it becomes possible to use them for social
purposes: one cannot be sure that every magical observance
had its origin in magical belief. Thus the food-rules of
Australian tribes consist of taboos upon the enjoyment of
certain foods by women and young men, and are plainly
devised in the interests of the gerontocracy: so why should
not a fiction be founded on Magic in the interest of absent
husbands?</p>

<p>The sanctity or dangerousness of the chief is probably due,
first, to his being really dangerous; but, secondly, to the
biological advantage to a tribe of respecting him, which
leads to a selection of those tribes amongst whom respect for
the chief arises. As biological adaptation is never more
than a moving, oscillating equilibrium, this feeling sometimes
becomes excessive, even to the point of insanity. Everything
the chief touches becomes taboo; only a few sacred
servants can approach him; he may be thus reduced to helplessness.
It is one of Nature’s checks upon tyranny. Such
is the force of taboo, that a Maori tribesman, being hungry,
seeing some food by the wayside, and eating it, on learning
that it was the remains of the meal of a sacred chief, immediately
fell ill, and died. The offence was fatal—as soon as
it was known. The dangerousness of women has been referred
to their weakness; association with them must be weakening,
and is therefore forbidden when exertion is needed.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Prof. Westermarck traces it to a “horror of blood”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> very
probably; but other things may co-operate towards it.
The life of women separates them from men, and brings them
into a freemasonry and community of interests, to which
men are not admitted; differentiates their mentality, until
the result is mysterious and therefore magical: the sexual
orgasm, being more like pain than anything that is not pain,
at once attractive and revulsive, acquires the same character.
Homicides and mourners, again, are liable to be taboo, either
because there clings to them the mysterious quality and taint
of death (a magical motive), or because they are followed by
the ghosts of the departed.</p>

<p>There are unlucky words which it is a social offence to
utter: words of ill-omen, but especially names of dead
people, demons and sometimes gods; for people are apt to
come when they are called, and, if the call is conceived of
according to Magic, come they certainly will. There are
likewise many actions that seem to us entirely innocent,
yet in one or another tribe must be avoided by all who desire
a prosperous or only a tranquil life. The Papagoe Indians
of Mexico forbid a girl at a certain time to scratch her head,
or even to touch her hair with her hand; for which there may
be an excuse in the sacredness of the head; but her brother
comes at the same time under the same restriction.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The
case seems to be a type of many taboos, as being due wholly
to suspicion and anxiety: an anxious mother who sees her
boy scratch his head is reminded of his sister who must not
do so; her fears are excited, and she prohibits the action
that excites her fear: it is taboo. Writing of a Bantu tribe,
M.&nbsp;Jounod says, “Most often taboos are inexplicable.”<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> So
are the penalties that await the breach of them: the punishment
rarely fits the crime. Premature baldness, failure in
hunting or fishing, boils, lameness, dysentery—may avenge
the eating of wild duck or marriage within the forbidden
circle. And if any such thing happens to a man, he is liable
to be accused of having broken a taboo; and that proves the
truth of the belief in taboo.</p>

<p>Besides things that are in their magical nature dangerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and therefore taboo, things inoffensive in themselves can sometimes
be made taboo by merely declaring them to be so,
or by setting up a symbolic notice that they are so, or by
laying a conditional curse upon anybody who meddles with
them. They have then become dangerous. This is the
common case of making a talisman by means of a spell,
transferring to it invisible power. Such practices, especially
common in Melanesia, are often useful as a cheap defence of
property (in gardens, for instance), but are also a means of
exaction and tyranny. The prevalence of taboo amongst
savages, by the way, enables them readily to appreciate our
great commandment to do no work on Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>


<h3><a id="ch04_08"></a>§ 8. Indirect or “Sympathetic” Magic</h3>

<p>The use of charms, rites and spells, having been established
in one department—say, hunting—may be extended
to others by analogy, and is confirmed there in the same
way, namely, by still doing one’s best. Having obtained
the charms and learnt, or invented, the rites and spells,
one applies them, but at the same time makes war or love as
cunningly as one can, cultivates one’s garden, drives a bargain,
and so forth, and ascribes all good results to the Magic. At
first, I suppose, all such action was direct, discharged at the
person or thing to be influenced. To slay an enemy a bone
of a dead man was pointed, or a crocodile’s tooth hurled, in
his direction (though, probably, not in his sight). To keep
off evil Magic a wish was expressed—“Never sharp barn
catch me”;<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> or to drive away a pest a command was issued,
as in Borneo: “O rats, sparrows and noxious insects, go
feed on the padi of people down river.”<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> But a time came
when Magic began also to be carried out by practices indirect
and purely dramatic, rites performed and spells recited not
at the person or thing to be affected, but upon some substitute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
or representative, or symbol; and this must have happened
pretty early; for dramatic Magic is met with in Australia.
To this sort of Magic belong the widely-diffused methods of
operating upon the image of a man or anything assigned to
stand for him, or upon hair-clippings, remains of food, or
footprints instead of himself; or of tying knots to bind, or
untying them to release a curse. With spells the indirect
method is less common, but remarkable examples of it occur
at a low level of culture. The Yabim of New Guinea, to
promote the growth of their taro, tell a story: “Once upon
a time, a man labouring in his field complained that he had
no taro-shoots. Then came two doves flying from Paum.
They had devoured much taro, and they perched upon a tree
in the field, and during the night vomited up all the taro.
Thus the man got so many shoots that he was even able to
sell some of them to other people.”<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Here, then, a mere
story of a wish fulfilled is substituted, as a spell, for the wish
itself, and expected to have the same effect upon the crop;
and as that is, indeed, true, any failure of it is no more liable
to be detected. But such practices seem to us sillier and less
promising even than direct Magic. What can be the meaning
of them?</p>

<p>The indirectness of a rite makes it more mysterious and
magical, and that is a recommendation. Moreover, its
dramatic character gives an imaginative satisfaction, which
must suffice to initiate such pantomime again and again.
Amongst ourselves many people are prone to dramatise every
situation of their lives; to act in imagination their loves,
their revenges, their opportunities of self-display, and to
derive satisfaction from such imaginations even to the weakening
of their will—satisfaction without effort or danger.
But although this impulse may initiate pantomimic magic,
it can hardly maintain it in the absence of any deeper satisfaction.
The belief in its efficacy, again, once established,
the effect of suggestion upon a victim of black Magic (who
by some means is acquainted with what has been done against
him) may have consequences that seem to verify the rites;
but this can only happen when a belief in the efficacy of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
practices already prevails. The power of suggestion depends
upon the belief; it cannot create the belief. We must fall
back upon coincidence. If, indeed, immediate and complete
coincidence were requisite, if, when one practised on an
enemy’s life, nothing less than his speedy death would do,
coincidences might be too rare to give the requisite confirmation.
But if some less injury will be acceptable, and if it
need not follow immediately; if a delay of not merely two
or three days, but two or three months will bring the event
within the limits of satisfaction; and if the degree of injury
may vary from death to a bad fall, or some failure in hunting
on the victim’s part, or a quarrel with his wife; if even (as
often happens) a misfortune to any one of his family may
suffice—the confirmatory coincidences will be tolerably
frequent. There must, of course, be many disappointments;
but these count for little, because the particular practice is
supported by a general belief in Magic; because men desire to
believe and are afraid to disbelieve; because failures are
explained by some error in performing the rites, or by the
counteraction of superior Magic, or by the intervention of
hostile spirits.</p>

<p>Special reasons for practising and believing in indirect
operations of black Magic are their greater secrecy and, therefore,
greater safety, and greater gratification of the love of
cunning: which last (I think) explains much of the elaboration
that marks these performances.</p>

<p>In the development of indirect Magic, very many of its
practices seem to involve one or other of the assumptions
often called the principles of sympathetic Magic, namely,
Mimesis and Participation: (1) that to operate upon a likeness
or representation, or by analogy, affects the person, or
object, or process imitated or represented as if it were directly
assailed; and (2) that a part or appurtenance of any one may,
in any magical undertaking, be substituted for the whole.
Among savages these principles (as has already been said)
are only latent forms of procedure, tacitly assumed, not
formulated, and cannot have been the source of the practices,
but must gradually have been established by them; but
when notions of scientific arrangement came into vogue, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
were discovered and explicitly stated by the early physicians
and alchemists, in whose thoughts Magic and Science were
not clearly differentiated.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that these principles are natural
consequences of the laws of the association (or reproduction)
of ideas. According to the “law of similarity,” an idea of
one thing often makes us think of another that resembles it:
hence the thought of an enemy is supposed to make me
think of an image of him, or the sight of his image makes me
think of him. According to the law “of contiguity,” any
two things having been seen or thought of together, thereafter
the thought or sight of one of them makes me think
of the other: hence the thought of an enemy makes me
think of his footprint, or his footprint reminds me of him.
Possibly. But must there not have been a long preparation
of ideas before the thought of an enemy awakens in me
these particular associations rather than many others? And
if they should occur to me, how do the laws of association
explain my astonishing belief that to put his image in the
fire, or to thrust a thorn into his footprint, or to dig it up,
carry it home and put it in the oven, will make him lame or
afflict him with some wasting disease? There must be some
system of ideas to determine these particular judgments.</p>

<p>Some, again, suppose that savages cannot distinguish
similarity from identity, part from whole; so that an image
appears to them to be in earnest the same thing as a man,
or his nail-parings the same as himself. Yet it is certain
that in their work-a-day life they do make these distinctions,
and that otherwise they could not get on at all. If, then,
in certain cases, and in Magic (which is all that concerns us
now), they act or speak as if unable to draw such distinctions,
it must be from an acquired incapacity in that connection;
just as in some cases they suffer from an acquired incapacity
to recognise that their beliefs are contradicted by experience;
that is to say, some fixed idea or dissociation prevents them
from comparing the facts; though sometimes it may be
merely that customary forms of speech hinder the expression
of distinctions that really exist among their ideas.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the supposed force of mimetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Magic rests upon the belief that as a man’s shadow or reflection
implies his presence, so does his image. And we shall
see that, in some cases, this explanation is not far from the
mark, though it cannot serve for all cases; inasmuch as the
image operated upon in any rite need not be a likeness (of
course it never is)—a stick will serve, if declared to stand
for the victim; and, moreover, his presence is not needed
in carrying out rites that act at a distance. What truth
there is in this view has been better expressed by Prof. Yrjö
Hirn:<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> namely, that a unity or solidarity exists between all
persons and things that stand to one another in a relationship
of contact or similarity, on account of a certain magical
virtue; and that this solidarity is not destroyed by any
breach of physical continuity. To take away a man’s cloak,
or a lock of his hair, or a remnant of his food, does not interrupt
the magical continuity which contact has established
with the man: something of him, his virtue, remains with it.
And in the same way an image of him contains something of
his virtue; for to the immature mind, images or pictures are
nothing but radiations or decortications of the thing itself, an
efflux, like the Epicurean <ins title="eidôla">εἴδωλα</ins>. Hence the bones of a saint
and his picture convey his virtue to a devotee by the same
process: both are conductors of some emanation from
himself. There is much truth in this theory.</p>

<p>When Animism is called in to explain Magic, this virtue
or emanation of a man is apt to be explained as his soul, or
part of it. A savage dislikes being photographed, lest you
should take away his soul. M. Jounod says the Bantu regard
a photograph as “an unsheathing of soul”;<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Mr. Dorsey
says no Dakota would have his portrait taken lest one of
his souls [out of four] should remain in the picture, instead
of going after death to spirit-land;<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Mr. Carl Lumholtz says
the Papagoes refused to be photographed, lest part of themselves
should be taken away, and remain behind after death.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
And it is a trick with some sorcerers to keep a looking-glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in which they pretend to catch the souls of their dupes;
and, of course, shadows and reflections are frequently confounded
with the soul. So if the use of an image in Magic
does not imply the presence of the man himself, generally it
does imply the presence of a very important part of him.
And this explanation is strengthened by an apparent exception;
for some Malays, when they make an image of an enemy
to compass his destruction, think it necessary before operating
to coax his soul into it by a potent spell.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">“Hither, Soul, come hither!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither, little one, come hither!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither, bird, come hither!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither, filmy one, come hither!”<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Must we not infer that these Malays have in some way lost
the common belief, and so are put to this extra trouble?</p>

<p>If it be asked how this account of the matter can justify
the use of a stick or stone instead of a man’s image, merely
assigning it to represent him, the reply (I think) is that the
stick is a symbol. Since images are never much like the man,
and may be unlike in all degrees, the stick is a sort of limiting
case. A symbol is always the remainder, or reminder, of
something that once had intrinsic value, as an image, shadow,
or reflection has by being or participating in the man’s soul.
Besides, it is perhaps a tacit assumption of Magic (as in other
departments of life—including Philosophy), “that whatever
for one’s purpose it is necessary to assume, is real or true”:
the situation demands it.</p>

<p>As to the magical continuity between a man and whatever
has been in contact with him, the belief in it may with some
confidence be derived from the fact that it retains his odour;
and when an animistic explanation is required, it is naturally
thought that this odour is his soul or soul-stuff, as the savour
of a burnt-offering is its soul-stuff that regales the gods.</p>

<p>Belief in the participation of an image, or part or appurtenance
of a man in the man himself, or in his virtue, or in his
soul, must give to rites of black Magic a great deal of the
subjective satisfaction which is a secret motive of all Magic.
The images, or nail-parings, or what not, identify the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to be attacked; they fix the wizard’s attention, vivify his
imagination, direct the spell whom to strike (as a dog is set
upon a trail), and heighten the joy of imaginary revenge.</p>

<p>There are, however, many cases usually classed as “sympathetic
Magic” that cannot without great violence be
explained in this way; and I complain of the epithet “sympathetic,”
as applied to all indirect Magic, that it implies
this explanation. Consider the Mandan buffalo-dances, the
hunting dance and the mating dance; these are imitations
or dramatic representations of the hunting of buffaloes and
of their mating, which they are designed to prosper: can
such dances be interpreted as the efflux or decortications of
the future hunt or mating? Or, again, the story of the
muræna (quoted above, p. 101) and its resuscitation by the
rising tide—is this a radiation of the budding of the taro
which it is expected to expedite? Such cases, which are pretty
numerous, must be understood upon some other ground than
“participation.”</p>

<p>Many rites and observances seem to depend upon the
notion of favourable or unfavourable currents of invisible
power, which may be taken advantage of, or influenced, to
obtain one’s ends, in hunting, or in obtaining rain, or in
fertilisation of animals or crops. It is good to plant seed,
or begin any undertaking, when the moon is waxing, or the
tide rising; for these events show that the set of the current
is favourable to increase or prosperity. Again, one may
incite the current or strengthen it, as in bringing on rain by
throwing water in the air, or by leaping to help the crops to
grow. To instigate or assist in such ways the ongoings of
Nature is not the same thing as to cause the event: a rain-wizard
does not pretend to procure rain in the dry season;
the times of ploughing, sowing, reaping (whatever rites may
accompany them) are not decided by Magic. Much pantomimic
Magic may be best understood as attempting to set up
such currents of causation rather than as directly causative.
Since instances of cause and effect are observed to repeat
themselves, a pantomimic murder, or a hunting dance, or
fertility-rites, may be considered as setting an example
which Nature is expected to follow: the muræna-spell promotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
vitality by merely describing an example of reinvigoration.
The Kai of N.E. New Guinea hold that if a man, by
falling on a stump of bamboo in the path, wounds himself
to death, it is because a sorcerer, having obtained something
infected with his victim’s soul-stuff, has spread it over a pile
stuck in the ground, and pretended to wound himself upon
it and to groan with pain.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The belief implies that such practices
are in vogue; and they seem to rely upon the assumption
that “what happens once will happen again”; and that
who shall repeat the disaster is determined by the presence,
among the conditions, of something belonging to the victim
in default of himself. It is not by sympathy or participation
that the “something infected with his soul-stuff” acts; but
by contributing to reinstate as far as possible all the circumstances
of a cause like the cause of the man’s death.</p>

<p>In other cases an exemplary cause may be constituted by
the substitution of similars that do not imply participation.
Dr. Haddon tells us that in the western islands of Torres
Straits<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> the Kuman vine breaks up in dry weather, and the
segments look like human bones; hence they are employed
in Magic. Similarly red ochre or some other stain may be
used instead of blood, so that a skeleton may be coloured
with it as a means of keeping it alive. In Chinese popular
religion, before setting up a new idol, it is first carried to the
temple of an older one, who is besought to let a portion of
his soul-stuff transmigrate into the new one; then, carried
to its own temple and enthroned, its hands, feet, eyes, mouth,
nose and ears are smeared with blood, <em>or with red paint</em>, to
open its senses and bring its soul into relation with the outer
world.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Such a substitution of similars is true in one sense;
red paint is a substitute for blood as colour: Magic requires
that it shall also be a substitute in other ways; and,
therefore, it is so. Thus, down and feathers thrown into the
air in Australian rain-rites are a substitute for clouds; in
Mandan hunting-rites, men disguised in buffalo-skins are a
substitute for buffaloes; and thus, by substitution, a cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
can always be constituted which, once having been set to
work, Nature is constrained to repeat the operation.</p>

<p>Ought we not, then, to recognise two kinds of indirect
Magic—the sympathetic, and what may be called the
exemplary?<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The rise of the wizard as a professional authority introduces
many changes into magical practice, and decisively alters its
social importance. He sometimes experiments in new rites
and spells or in new versions of the old ones; he decides some
matters arbitrarily, as in imposing taboos on food; generally,
he develops the art in the direction of his professional interests,
learning to conjure, act, ventriloquise, suggest, hypnotise,
and to provide excuses for failure; he begins to train novices,
form a school and establish a tradition which influences the
whole life of his tribe. How far arbitrary elements enter into
rites it is impossible to say, until some one shall discover (as
some one may) marks by which to distinguish them. Meanwhile,
there may be many rites, or ritual elements, that
cannot be explained on any known principles of Magic,
because in fact they are arbitrary: still, such things must
usually be an imitation of other magical practices. Prof.
Leuba suggests, probably enough, that rites may sometimes
be adopted to relieve excitement, such as the dancing of
women when the men are at war.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> It was the custom (<abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>)
of Araucanian women; and as they danced, they swept the
dust away with their fans, and sang: “As we sweep the
dust away, so may our husbands scatter the enemy.” If
this was arbitrarily invented, it was by analogy with much
mimetic Magic: they set an example of what should happen
and confirmed it with a spell.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<h3><a id="ch04_09"></a>§ 9. The Dissolution of Magic</h3>

<p>In spite of the human mind’s strong proclivity to Magic,
the art, after rising to a maximum power and reputation, in
course of time loses its influence, and is to be found festering
only in the backwater and stagnant pools of society. Its
power is not at the zenith in primitive society, but much later,
when there are men in command of great wealth who feel
insecure, and turn for confidence to diviners and thaumaturgists,
whom they bribe heavily to give what they most desire.
But by that time Magic is confused with Animism. As civil
order and material civilisation prevail, Magic is no longer
invoked to increase one’s confidence, because this is ensured
by the regularity of ordinary affairs. As positive methods
in war, building, commerce are learnt and practised, the
magical accompaniments of such undertakings, without being
wholly disused, may become less and less important—what
we call “survivals,” such as the breaking of a bottle of wine
on the bows when launching a ship (it is forgotten that the
wine must be red). Or they may be lost altogether without
injury to industry; whereas in savage economy there is some
risk that a most useful craft, such as pottery, weaving, or
canoe-building, may be entirely discontinued, if by the
extinction of some group of men or women the rites and songs
are forgotten with which such labour had always been made
good.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> For who would trust a pot or a canoe unconsecrated?</p>

<p>The great systematisations of Oneiromancy, Alchemy,
Cheiromancy, Astrology, necessarily come forward late in the
day, because they involve the constitution of science; but
for that reason they are soon discredited by being confronted
with the positive sciences; when, without being forgotten,
they are relegated to what may be euphemistically called
“select circles.”</p>

<p>With the growth of Animism, again, pure Magic becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
comparatively rare; its observances are interpreted according
to the fashionable creed, no longer as setting occult,
quasi-mechanical forces to work, but as requiring the intervention
of a spirit or a god. They become symbolic: ritual
now does nothing of itself, but is a sign of what the god does,
or is desired to do. Yet Magic often has its revenge upon
Animism: enchaining by mysterious uniformities the god
himself.</p>

<p>In its own nature Magic comprises qualities that tend to
weaken it (at least, to weaken each particular form of it)
and to bring about its decline. Magical rites and spells, on
whatever scale performed, are things to be repeated, and
what is repeated is mechanised and ceases to live. Custom
can maintain a practice whilst dispensing with its meaning;
slowly the practice (spell or ritual) is slurred and corrupted.
Economy, “least effort,” is the enemy of all ceremonial.
There is also a tendency to the attenuation of rites on the
principle (unconscious, of course) that “the sign of a sign is a
sign of the thing signified”; whereby a meaning may be
disguised in a symbol for the sake of secrecy, or even for
politeness. Prof. Westermarck has shown how, in Morocco,
the full rite for averting the evil eye is to throw forward the
hand with outspread fingers and to exclaim, “Five in your
eye.” But as this is too insulting for common use, you may
instead casually mention the number “five”; or if even that
be too plain-spoken, you can refer to “Thursday,” which
happens to be the fifth day of the week. In this process
there is great risk of forgetting the original meaning of the
rite or spell; and when this comes to pass, we are left with
the empty shells of superstition, such as a dread of “thirteen,”
“Friday,” salt-spilling, walking under a ladder; for hardly
a soul knows what they mean.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<br />ANIMISM</h2>


<h3><a id="ch05_01"></a>§ 1. What is Animism?</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span>, when the cohesion of the hunting-pack had weakened,
belief in Magic by giving authority to elders became very
influential and useful in primitive societies, still greater in
subsequent evolution has been the power of Animism. For
belief in ghosts led in time to the worship of ancestors, and
then especially to the worship of the ancestors of chiefs or
heroes, some of whom became gods; and the belief in gods
strengthened the authority of chiefs and kings who were
descended from them, and helped to maintain the unity of the
tribe or nation from generation to generation and from age
to age.</p>

<p>In anthropology, the term Animism is usually employed
to denote the proneness of savages and barbarians, or people
of unscientific culture, to explain natural occurrences, at
least the more remarkable or interesting—the weather, the
growth of crops, disease and death—as due to the action of
spirits: (1) ghosts (that is, spirits that have formerly been
incarnate); (2) dream-spirits, that have temporarily quitted
some body during sleep or trance; (3) invisible, living,
conscious beings that have never been incarnate. This may
be called Hyperphysical Animism. Sometimes, however,
“Animism” is used to denote a supposed attitude of savages
and children toward all things, animate and inanimate, such
that they spontaneously and necessarily attribute to everything
a consciousness like our own, and regard all the actions
and reactions of natural objects as voluntary and purposive.
And this may be called Psychological Animism. These two
meanings of “Animism” are entirely different: it is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
thing to regard an object as moved by its own mind, another
to attribute its movement or influence to a separable agent
which for the time possesses it; it is one thing to regard
an object as having an anthropomorphic consciousness,
another to believe that that consciousness is a distinct power
capable of quitting it and sometimes returning, or of surviving
its destruction, or of existing independently. Even
if the doctrine of Animism in the second sense were granted,
it would remain to be shown how men came to conceive
that the consciousness of a thing can be separated from it,
and exist and act by itself, and even with greater powers
than it had before—contrary to the opinion of Don Juan,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“that soul and body, on the whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were odds against a disembodied soul.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Savages do not always regard a separable spirit as necessarily
belonging even to human nature. Dr. Seligman writes
that, among the Veddas, a few old men “were by no means
confident that all men on their death became <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">yaku</i>” (veridical
ghosts). Influential men and mediums would do so; but
for the rest, at Godatalawa it was determined by experiment.
The ordinary man was invoked soon after death, and desired
to give good success in hunting; and if much game was
then obtained, he had become a <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">yaka</i>.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Messrs. Spencer
and Gillen tell us that, according to the Guanjis, a woman
has no <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">moidna</i> (spirit part).<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Major C.&nbsp;H. Stigand says “the
Masai have no belief in a future state for any but chiefs”;
the common dead are not even buried, but merely thrown
out into the bush.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Among the Omaha, though each person
has a spirit that normally survives the body, still, a suicide
ceases to exist.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In Tonga the souls of the lowest rank
of the people (Tooas) died with their bodies.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The human
spirit, then, is not necessarily believed to enter upon a life
after death; still less is the spirit of an animal. On the
other hand, it is held by many tribes that something inherent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
in weapons, utensils, food and other objects, a “soul” or
soul-stuff, may be separable from them and go to Hades or
serve as the food of spirits, although the things themselves
are not regarded as having a spirit or intelligent life.</p>


<h3><a id="ch05_02"></a>§ 2. Psychological Animism</h3>

<p>Andrew Lang described savages as existing in “a confused
frame of mind to which all things, animate and inanimate,
... seem on the same level of life, passion and reason.”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
Children and other immature people are often supposed to
be in the same condition. As to children, it is pointed out
how deeply concerned they are about dolls and rocking-horses,
how passionately they turn to strike a table after
knocking their heads against it. But probably it is now
admitted that impulsive retaliation, on a table or bramble
or shirt-stud (not unknown to civilised men), implies not
any belief in the malignity or sensitiveness of those objects.
Animals behave in the same way. Th. Roosevelt reports
that an elephant was seen to destroy in rage a thorn tree
that had pricked its trunk;<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and that in America he himself
saw a bear that was burying a carcass, and lost hold of it
and rolled over, strike it a savage whack, like a pettish child.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
Moreover, in children, such behaviour is in large measure
due to suggestion; inasmuch as the setting of them to beat
the table, or what not, is an easy way of diverting them from
their own pain. And, of course, the dealing with dolls, or
rocking-horses, or walking-sticks, as if alive, is play. Such
play involves intense imaginative belief, which, at first, is
not clearly differentiated from earnest. But this stage
corresponds with the play of the young of the higher animals,
whilst they are still physically incapable of completing the
preluded actions; and the engrossing interest of their play
expresses the biological necessity of it as a means of developing
their mental and bodily faculties. By the time that children
are at all comparable with savages, their play has become a
temporary attitude, compatible with brusque transition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
matter-of-fact, or even with actions which at the height of
play show that the illusion is incomplete.</p>

<p>In savages, likewise, much of the behaviour that is supposed
to betray an illusionary animism, even in their simple apprehension
of things, is really an acquired way of acting, in a
temporary attitude, under the influence of imagination-belief,
and is compatible with other actions that show how
incomplete is the illusion. Andrew Lang, after the passage
above quoted, appears to limit the scope of it by the words
“when myth-making”: no doubt, when myth-making and
in practising many rites, savages speak or act as if they
believed in the full sense that the objects dealt with are
sensitive intelligent beings; and yet their effective conduct
toward them is entirely positive. They may, for example,
feed the growing rice-plant with pap; in harvesting it, speak
a secret language that the rice may not understand them
and be alarmed, and proceed to cut it with knives concealed
in their palms: but they do cut it. They carry it home and
garner it with honour, and come from time to time to take a
portion for food with solemn observances: but then they
cook and eat it.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Their animistic attitude, therefore, is not
primitive, spontaneous, necessary illusion, but an acquired,
specialised way of imagining and dealing with certain things.
Were it not possible to combine in this way the imaginative
with the practical, all wizardry and priestcraft would be
nothing but the sheer cheating which it often seems to be
to superficial observers. Normally, imagination-beliefs that
have only indirect biological utility (say, in maintaining
customs in order to ensure the tribe’s welfare) are unable
to overcome immediate biological needs (say, for food and
shelter); but often they do so within certain limits, or in
certain directions, as in innumerable taboos of food, customs
of destroying a man’s property at his death, starving or
maiming tribesmen on the war-path. A universal taboo on
rice is not inconceivable. For these are social-pathological
cases; like the self-destructive beliefs of individuals and
sects amongst ourselves, such as the faith-healers, who in
sickness call upon their god instead of a physician.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>Children, savages and ourselves, in some degree, attribute
spontaneously to <em>some</em> inanimate things, in our mere apprehension
of them (for this has nothing to do with the metaphysics
of Pampsychism), something more than external
existence: regarding them as force-things and, by empathy,
as experiencing effort and quiescence, strain and relief, and
sometimes emotion and pain. It is for this attitude toward
nature that I adopt Mr. Marett’s term “animatism”: as
not ascribing to inanimate things, or to plants, in general,
anything like a human personal consciousness; but merely
an obscure, fragmentary, partial consciousness, enough to
correspond with our occasional experiences in dealing with
them. Perhaps those observers who report in strong terms
universal Animism as the tenet of a tribe, mean no more
than this; for example, the author above quoted as writing
in the <cite>American Bureau of Ethnology</cite>, who says (p. 433)
that according to the Dakotas, everything—“the commonest
sticks and clays”—has a spirit that may hurt or help and
is, therefore, to be propitiated. It would be unjust to the adherents
of psychological Animism to accuse them of believing
that savages have universally made so much progress in
“faculty Psychology” as to distinguish personality, will,
passion and reason; especially as they add that savages
project these powers into all natural objects through incapacity
for discrimination and abstraction; and, at the same
time, know very well that in some languages of the most
animistic tribes (e.&nbsp;g. Algonquin and Naga) the distinction
of animate and inanimate is the ground of grammatical
gender.</p>

<p>We find, accordingly, that some explorers explicitly deny
that, in their experience, savages regard all things as on the
same level of life, passion and reason. Dr. Coddrington says
that, in the Banks’ Islands, yams and such things are not
believed to have any <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">tarunga</i> (spirit)—“they do not live
with any kind of intelligence”;<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and that Melanesians do
not fail to distinguish the animate and the inanimate. Messrs.
Skeat and Blagden report that with the Semang of the Malay
Peninsula there is very little trace of animistic beliefs; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
they relate a folk-tale of how a male elephant tells a female
that he has found a live stone (pangolin rolled into a ball):
“Swine,” said the female, “stones are never alive.”<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Messrs.
Hose and McDougall tell us that the Kayans hang garments
and weapons on a tomb, and seem to believe that shadowy
duplicates of these things are at the service of the ghost,
but that such duplicates are inert (relatively) and not to be
confused with the principle of intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> “Soul” does
not imply personality.</p>

<p>To be clear about Animism, it is necessary to bear in mind
several modes of belief: (1) Hyperphysical Animism, that
certain things have, or are possessed by a conscious spirit,
and that this spirit is a separable entity; (2) that things
are themselves conscious (or semi-conscious), but their
consciousness is not a separable entity; (3) that things
are not conscious, but are informed by a separable
essence, usually called soul (better, soul-stuff), which may
be eaten by spirits, or may go to ghost-land with them;
(4) the extension or limitation of these beliefs to more
or fewer classes of things. Unless these distinctions are
recognised, any report upon savage beliefs can hardly be
clear and adequate; but generally we may take it that when
a traveller tells us that such and such things are not believed
to have souls, and says nothing of any belief as to their
consciousness, he means (except with regard to animals)
to deny that anything like human consciousness is attributed
to them. And when Mr. Torday writes that, according to
the Bahuana of the Upper Congo, there are two incorporeal
parts—<i lang="und" xml:lang="und">doshi</i>, common to man, animals and fetiches, and <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">bun</i>,
peculiar to man—he seems to leave it as a matter of course
that plants and inanimate things have neither of these, and
are not conscious beings; though probably some of them
have soul-stuff, since clothes, weapons and food are buried
with a corpse.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The Rev. J.&nbsp;H. Weeks says that the Bakongo
of the Lower Congo attribute a spirit only to the <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">nkasa</i> tree
(from whose bark the ordeal poison is derived) amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
plants;<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and, similarly, the Baloki, further up the river,
attribute a spirit only to the <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">nka</i> tree.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Since many things
are buried by these people in a grave, or broken above it,
the things may be supposed to have soul-stuff; but from
the denying of spirits to plants, and from silence as to
psychological Animism, it may be inferred that neither
plants nor inanimate things are regarded as conscious beings.
Sir E.&nbsp;F. im Thurn tells us that material things of all sorts
are believed by the natives of Guiana to have each a body
and a spirit—evidently a conscious and malicious spirit;
“and that not all inanimate objects have this dual nature
avowedly attributed to them, is probably only due to the
chance that ... the spirit has not yet been noticed in some
cases.”<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Even with these Guiana Indians, then, whose
Animism, in every sense, is unusually active and extensive,
their attitude is an acquired, specialised way of imagining
and dealing with things that draw their attention and excite
their suspicions, not a primitive, necessary illusion; else
there could be no exceptions.</p>

<p>The reasonable view, therefore, is that savages distinguish
between themselves and certain animals, on the one hand,
and, on the other, the remaining animals, plants and inanimate
things; and raise the second class to the rank of
the first, as conscious agents, only when there are special
incentives to do so. To find all the causes that excite the
animistic attitude toward things would be a difficult task,
but some of them may be indicated. Beginning from
Animatism, which really is a primitive and necessary illusion,
it is reasonable to expect:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That any plant or inanimate thing adopted as a Totem
should, by that very fact, be endowed with human consciousness;
though the savage mind is too inconsistent for
us to infer that this must always happen.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That whatever seems to move or act spontaneously,
like the winds and streams and echoes, the sun, moon, planets,
and shooting stars, should be felt as a spiritual agency;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
especially if it cry out with empathetic reverberation, as
winds and cataracts do, trees tormented by the storm, waves,
fire, and the ice-floe when it breaks up in spring; or if it
excite fear by being extraordinary and dangerous, as thunder
and lightning are, whirlwinds and whirlpools, waterspouts
and volcanoes. Dr. Speisser writes that at Ambrym, when
the volcano is active, the natives climb to the top and bring
sacrifices to appease it, throwing coco-nuts and yams into the
crater.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That whatever has been regarded as having magical
force should be treated—after the rise of the ghost-theory
(supposing this to be of later origin) has given vogue to a new
principle of explanation—as owing its virtue to a spirit,
either by immanence or possession (two modes of actuation
which may or may not be distinguished), and so become a
fetich, instead of being merely an amulet or talisman.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) That whatever is much used in ritual, especially if
often addressed in spells or incantations, should become an
object of reverence, apt to be personified and raised to, or
even above, the human level as a conscious agent: for
example, padi and rice in Indonesia, the ordeal tree on the
Congo, already mentioned. Fire-sticks used in the ritual of
sacrifice are often deified. In India, the conch, having for
ages been used in religious rites, “the people gradually came
to revere the instrument itself and to adore and invoke it.”<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
“A strange religious feature [of the <cite>Rigveda</cite>] pointing to a
remote antiquity is the occasional deification and worship
even of objects fashioned by the hand of man, when regarded
as useful to him. These are chiefly sacrificial implements.”<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
The practice now extends in India to nearly every tool and
utensil. Amongst the very few inanimate gods of the
Cherokees are the Stone, invoked by the Shaman when
seeking lost goods by means of a pebble suspended by a
string; and the Flint, invoked when about to scarify a patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
with an arrow-head before rubbing in medicine.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> By the
Apache, heddontin (pollen of the cat-tail rush) is used as the
sacrificial powder in nearly all rites, and is personified and
prayed to.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> When spells are addressed to any object, the
analogy of address to human beings tends to cause that object
to be thought of as humanly conscious.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Stocks and stones have been worshipped, as the dwelling-place
of spirits in many parts of the world; having superseded
in the mind of their devotees the ghost of the men
whose burial-place they formerly marked, but who themselves
have been forgotten; and probably, on the analogy
of these stones, others that no ghost ever haunted.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Where Animism is active amongst a timid and suspicious
people, whatever injures a man is believed to act of
malice: as amongst the Indians of Guiana, who are so timid
that rather than go hunting alone they will take a woman or
a child along with them.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>Under such conditions as these a sort of acquired psychological
Animism is very widely though very irregularly diffused;
but were it universal and uniform, it could not of
itself account for hyperphysical Animism—the doctrine that
men (or some men), some animals, plants, things, places,
are possessed or informed by spirits that are capable of
separate existence.</p>


<h3><a id="ch05_03"></a>§ 3. The Ghost Theory</h3>

<p>Hyperphysical Animism may be easiest understood as
having arisen with the belief in human ghosts. The causes
of this belief have been fully set forth by Herbert Spencer<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
and Sir E.&nbsp;B. Tylor<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> in a way that to my mind is convincing.
Amongst those causes dreams predominate; wherein the
dead are met again as in the flesh. The living body having
always been for the savage a conscious force-thing, at death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the conscious force leaves the thing or corpse. This might
be accepted by him as a fact of the same kind as the loss
of its virtue by a talisman or amulet (which is known sometimes
to happen), were it not for dreams in which the dead
still live. That this conscious force that has left the body
is not visible except in dreams need excite little wonder,
since many forces natural and magical are invisible.</p>

<p>A dream not being common to two men at the same time,
the things that are seen in it cannot be pointed out, nor
therefore directly named (in this resembling subjective
experiences). It was for ages impossible to narrate a dream
as a dream: there was no way of distinguishing it from
external events, either for the dreamer himself or (were
that possible) in reporting it to another. He was far away
and met his father, yet had lain by the fire all night! Hence
to find names with which to describe such things men turned
to other ways in which they seemed to have a double existence,
to shadows and reflections: which in their sudden
appearance and disappearance, and sometimes faint, sometimes
distorted outlines, bear some resemblance to dream-images;
and probably it is felt to be significant that shadows
and reflections disappear at night, just when dreams occur.
Shadows and reflections are not necessarily identified with
the ghost derived from the dream-image, because their names
are given to it; but sometimes they certainly are; so that a
man who, on looking into water, happens not to see his
reflection may believe that his spirit has gone away, and that
he himself must be ill, and accordingly he becomes ill; or
if at noon near the equator he notices that he has no shadow,
he may think his soul is gone, and run to a medicine-man to
get it back; and dead bodies may be believed to have no
shadows.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Inasmuch as a body even lying on the ground
casts a shadow, except at tropical noon, the belief that it does
not do so at any time implies an acquired inability to see
what is before one’s eyes; as sometimes happens in hypnosis
and other conditions of negative hallucination.</p>

<p>The idea of a separable conscious personal force, or spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that leaves the body at death, serves also, as it gathers
strength, to explain sleep, fainting, epilepsy; and sometimes
every sickness is attributed to the partial detachment or
desertion of the spirit; which, therefore, it is the doctor’s
business to plug in, or to catch and restore; or (if I rightly
remember a report of Miss Kingsley’s) he may even supply
another one from a basketful of souls kept at hand for
such exigencies.</p>

<p>That the ghost theory arises not only from dreams, but is
also suggested by hallucinations and hypnagogic visions is
very probable. In various parts of the world savages have
been described as having visions of remarkably coherent and
convincing vividness that seem not to have been dreams.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
But such experiences, even when artificially induced by
fasting or drugs (as happens among many tribes), are rare
in comparison with dreams; and to the influence of dreams
upon these savage beliefs there is abundant testimony. With
some tribes dreams are treated as part of their objective
experience; so that to be injured by your neighbour in a
dream is just ground for avenging yourself as soon as you
wake; and to see a dead man in a dream is, therefore, clear
proof of his continued existence, and that either he has
come to the dreamer or the dreamer has gone to visit him.</p>

<p>Thus Sir Everard im Thurn says of the native of Guiana,
his dreams are as real as any events of his waking life; his
dream-actions are done by his spirit: in dreams he continues
to see the dead—that is, their spirits.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Similarly, the Lengua
Indians (W. of R. Paragua) have great faith in dreams;
wherein the spirit is believed to leave the body and to do in
fact what is dreamed.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> According to the Cherokees, to dream
of being bitten by a snake requires the same treatment as
actual snake-bite; else (perhaps years later) the same inflammation
will appear in the wounded spot, with the same
consequences.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The Motu hold that <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">sua</i> (ghosts or spirits)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
are seen in dreams, and that when a man sleeps his own
<i lang="und" xml:lang="und">sua</i> leaves his body.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> “The Lifuans believe in the reality
of what is seen in a dream, and are influenced by it. Their
dead ancestors appeared in dreams.”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> And the Polynesians
of Manatuki thought that “dreams were occasioned by the
spirit going to the places seen in them.”<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Many more of
such witnesses might be cited.</p>

<p>It is recognised by psychologists that dreams, as immediate
experience, have more the character of perception than of
imagination. Children are apt to confuse dreams with
reality. It can only have been gradually, with the growing
knowledge of continuity and coherence in the course of events,
and therewith the demand for corroboration of testimony,
that dreams were distinguished from the waking life. When
no longer supposed to be all of them real, some are still so
regarded: the Dieri, amongst lower savages, distinguish
between visions, as revelations made by Kutchi (an evil
Spirit), and ordinary dreams, as mere fancies.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> But so
impressive are dreams to many people, in their eagerness to
know more than sense and philosophy can tell them, that
they persist in hoping, and therefore believing, that dreams,
if they give no knowledge of this world, may still be revelations
of another, perhaps more real; or if not revelations,
adumbrations by way of allegory, which some learned or
inspired Daniel may interpret; or, at least, omens of good
or evil, which the ancient science of Oneiromancy undertakes
to explain. There is now a new and more promising Oneiromancy
that interprets dreams as indicating not the future,
but one’s own past, chiefly a forgotten past, and teaches
to know oneself: more promising; for what but experience
can possibly be the source of dreams—at least, of dream-elements?
Some of the new principles of interpretation,
however, may compare for obscurity with the ancient.</p>

<p>That the dead are seen alive in dreams is, then, for the
savage a fact of observation; and, therefore, the continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
existence of the dead is, for him, not in the first place supernatural;
although it may be called hyperphysical, because
it is experienced only in dreams and not by daylight, and is
exempt from ordinary conditions of time and place. But
it gradually becomes supernatural, as the capricious incidents
of dream-life are felt to be “uncanny,” as that which occurs
only at night is involved in the fears of the night, and as a
great cloud of imaginations accumulates about the dead and
obscures the simple facts of dream-perception in which the
belief originated. This cloud of imaginations, by its mysterious
character and by various alliances with Magic, spreads
and deepens until it overshadows the whole of human life;
is generally, indeed, dispersed here and there by the forces
of biological necessity, often by subterfuges laughable
enough; which have, however, the merit of saving mankind
from destruction: but sometimes it extinguishes the last ray
of common sense, impoverishes the believer, enfeebles him,
fills his days and nights with terror, gives him over to practices
the most cruel or the most disgusting, leads him to slay his
own tribesmen, his own children, his own parents, and to
offer up himself in the sure hope of resurrection.</p>


<h3><a id="ch05_04"></a>§ 4. Extension of the Ghost Theory to Animals</h3>

<p>Spirits, having once been conceived of as explaining the
actions of men and surviving their bodily death, may by
analogy be conceived to explain the action of any other things
in circumstances that suggest a motive for the action, and
therefore to possess or inhabit such things, and to be capable
of separating from them, like ghosts. Other things are
already, by Magic and Animatism, force-things, in some
degree conscious, whose forces may be capable of acting
invisibly at a distance; and at the death of a man it is his
conscious force that leaves the body and becomes a ghost.
Since, then, there is hardly any natural object whose action
may not in some circumstances seem to be interpretable
by motives, especially amongst a timid and suspicious people,
how can we assign any necessary limits to the spread of
Animism? Moreover, the causes most influential in establishing
the ghost theory for man directly require its extension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to other things. For not human beings only are seen in
dreams, but also their clothes, weapons and utensils, and also
animals, plants, localities. If, then, the dead, because they
are seen in dreams, are inferred still to live under conditions
in which they are not visible by daylight to ordinary men,
how can the inference be avoided that all sorts of things,
artefacts, animals, plants, localities, share in that mode of
existence—that all have their doubles? And “Why not?”
the savage might ask, since it is literally true of all things,
without exception, that they are sometimes visible, sometimes
invisible.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Similar inferences seem to be justifiable
from the alliance of ghosts with shadows and reflections,
and the fact that not man only but everything else has a
shadow and a reflection, and that their shadows and reflections
disappear at night, just when the things themselves sometimes
appear in dreams. Moreover, so far as the breath,
the pulse, the shining of the eye, which cease in the human
corpse, are sometimes identified with the departed spirit,
the same processes likewise cease at the death of animals;
though, it is true, there is here no analogy with inanimate
things, and the breathing and circulation of plants are
beyond the savage’s observation. Therefore, although
Animism is an inferential construction, were the construction
entirely due to the logic of analogy, there would be nothing
surprising in the discovery that the belief “that everything
has a ghost” is just as universal and uniform in the human
race as if it had been an innate or primitive belief. That,
on the contrary, Animism prevails very irregularly amongst
the tribes of men; that, in all directions, inferences that are
analogically specious fail to be drawn; that instead of a
general system of Animism every tribe has its own Animism;
this is surprising and needs to be explained. The extension
of the theory is easier to understand than its irregular
limitation.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that we are at present considering Animism
as a belief in ghosts, not in spirits generally (to which we shall
come in Sec. 6), I venture to think that, although dreams,
shadows and reflections certainly suggest a double existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of everything, yet savages never assign a true ghost to
anything inanimate, nor to plants, nor even to animals,
unless there is a special reason for doing so; because only
in the case of human beings is the suggestion interesting
enough to take hold of the social imagination. Hence, even
though other things appear in the ghost-world, they have
no significance there, except in relation to human ghosts
(or ghostlike spirits) on whom they attend. Accordingly,
human ghosts have a place in the beliefs of every tribe,
because human beings excite affection, admiration and fear,
have well-marked individuality; are therefore remembered
and have stories told of them; and if they are seen after
death, it is, of course, reported. The evidence makes it
only too plain that the paralysis of attention by fear is the
chief (though not the only) emotional factor of belief in
ghosts; and what other thing in all nature is to be feared
in comparison with one’s fellow-man?</p>

<p>The belief in ghosts, escaped and roaming independent of
any normally visible body, as a social belief, is involved in
the practice of reporting and discussing dreams, which
becomes the same thing as telling ghost-stories—the first
and most persistent motive of literature. Stories can only
be told effectively of things generally interesting; and, at
first, such things must have been recognisable by the hearers
and must have had some individuality. <span class="nobreak">Hence—</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Animals that attain to such individuality may have
ghosts: (i) An animal that occasions widespread fear, such
as a man-eating tiger. We must distinguish from such cases
the frequent beliefs that tigers, wolves, sharks, snakes, etc.,
are, or are possessed by, the spirits or ghosts of men. (ii)
An animal that comes to be upon terms of special intimacy
with men; such as the very tame dogs and pigs that come
when they are called among the Bakongo;<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> or hunting dogs
that have been specially doctored among the Baloki.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Animals slain at funeral feasts to accompany the dead
have ghosts so far as necessary for that purpose; but, wanting
individuality and personal interest, they make no further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
figure in ghost-lore; they do not “walk” or revisit the
glimpses of the moon. Thus the Tanghouls say that ghosts,
on reaching Kazairam (their Hades), find the gates barred
against them by the deity Kokto; so at the burial feast of a
rich man a buffalo is killed, that his mighty ghost may burst
open the massive gates of that abode. Poor ghosts must
wait about outside, till a rich one comes up with his buffalo;
when they all rush in behind him.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> But we hear nothing
further of the buffalo. In the Banks’ Islands, pigs killed at
a funeral feast have no true ghosts to follow the dead to
Panoi, but only a sort of wraith; because they only go for
show, that their master may be well received there.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Animals that are important prey to a hunting tribe
are often believed to have ghosts that may be hunted by dead
tribesmen; or that must be propitiated when one of them is
slain: the ghosts, for example, of seals and bears are bribed
by the Esquimo to entice other seals and bears to come and
be killed. A seal desires above everything, they say, a
drink of fresh water; so as soon as one is brought ashore
a dipperful is poured into his mouth; else the other seals
will not allow themselves to be caught. The polar bear
(male) desires crooked knives and bow-drills, or (female)
women’s knives and needle-cases. Hence, when a bear is
killed, its ghost accompanies its skin into the hunter’s hut;
and the skin is hung up with the appropriate tools for four
or five days. Then the bear-ghost is driven out by a magic
formula, takes with it the souls of the tools, and reports well
of the hunter in bear-soul land. Whilst in the hut, as an
honoured guest, nothing is done that it dislikes in human
customs.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) In the development of mythology, animals and monsters
of various kinds may be found inhabiting shadow-land;
but these are not true ghosts of any particular things that
once died in this world.</p>

<p>This list of the ways in which animals may come to have
ghosts is not offered as exhausting all the cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="ch05_05"></a>§ 5. Ghosts and Soul-stuff</h3>

<p>A ghost is a disembodied soul, having a consciousness and
power at, or generally (because it is feared) above, the
human level; but there may be disembodied souls, or souls
capable of disembodiment, that have no consciousness, or
none above the level of Animatism. Even if a living thing
have a consciousness, its post-mortem apparition may not;
like the Banks’ Islanders’ pig, which, though “a distinguished
animal and acknowledged to be intelligent,” has no true ghost.
Among nearly all tribes, whatever is offered in sacrifice to
gods or left in, or at, the tombs of men deceased, is believed
to have some sort of soul; because, plainly, spirits do not
eat or consume the visible food or utensils; yet it is necessary
to the success of the rites to suppose that the spirits are
satisfied; they must, therefore, take the souls of the offerings.
And what can be more plausible reasoning than to argue
that, as solid men eat solid food, ghosts eat ghostly food?
“Soul” thus appears as a sort of ghost-substance, or ghost-body.
For, in dreams, the departed are seen as if in the
flesh; and moreover analogy requires that the ghost consciousness
and ghost-force shall have a body of some sort, and, of
course, one that will maintain in ghost-land the same relations
to other things that the mortal body did in this world.
In ghost-land, or shadow-land, or dream-land, the substance
of all things is this soul-stuff. Sometimes the force of
analogy requires a tribe to believe that, in order that the
souls of things (such as earthen pots or weapons) may be
released to accompany a ghost to the underworld, the things
themselves must be “killed,” that is to say, broken; but
other tribes are not such consistent logicians; and in some
cases where things left exposed at a grave (not buried) are
broken, it may be to prevent their being stolen.</p>

<p>Anything, then, may have “soul” after its kind: relatively
inert things have relatively inert souls, but never true ghosts;
some animals may have ghosts, especially if they have attained
to a certain individuality, but generally only in so far as they
are imagined to attend upon human ghosts or spirits. Inasmuch
as the word “soul” is often used as equivalent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
“ghost,” it would be convenient always to speak of the
soul which is ghost-food, or ghost-body, “as soul-stuff.”<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
Soul-stuff is conceived of as material, though subtle and
normally invisible. A man’s soul-stuff may be regarded
not only as permeating his body, but also as infecting everything
he possesses or touches: no doubt by analogy with his
odour; for a man’s odour is a personal quality, distinguishable
by dogs and (I believe) by some savages and hypnotic subjects;
and the stench of his putrefying corpse may be supposed
to convey his courage and skill to those who inhale
it.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> And the savour of a burnt-offering is food for gods.
Indeed, Ellis says explicitly that, in Tahiti, food was put to
the mouth of a chieftain’s corpse; because, they said, there
was a spiritual as well as a material part of food, a part which
they could smell.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Savage ideas are generally so little thought out, and are so
irregularly thought out by different tribes, that the relation
of a thing to its soul-stuff varies widely from one tribe to
another. In many cases the extraction by ghost or god of
the soul-stuff from an offering may affect it so little, that the
devotee or the priest proceeds to feast upon it; and I have
nowhere met with the notion (which logic requires) that
such metaphysically eviscerated food can only nourish a
man’s body and not his soul. However, since the eating of
the sacrifice may be an act of communion with the ghost,
he then naturally extracts the goodness only from his own
share. In other cases, the breaking of weapons and utensils
buried with a corpse implies an intimate unity between the
wholeness of an object and its soul-stuff; and the Rev. J.&nbsp;H.
Weeks says of the considerable wealth put into a grave by
the Bakongo, that only the shell or semblance of anything is
supposed to remain there.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>This conception of soul-stuff may have been an important
contribution to metaphysics. The doctrine of material
substance is reached by abstracting all the qualities of things;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
but then there would be nothing left, were it not for this
venerable idea of something invisible and intangible in
things in which qualities may “inhere,” or which may serve
as a “support” to them; so that, when it is taken away
there is only a shell or semblance of anything left. But such
a tenet is uncommon. Along another line of speculation
this soul-stuff may become the Soul of the World. When
by philosophers spirits are no longer conceived to have
bodies, but to be the very opposite of bodies, a spiritual
substance must be invented to support their qualities, in
order to put them upon an equal footing of reality with
corporeal things; but as there is no spirit-stuff ready made
by the wisdom of our forefathers, this concept remains
uncomfortably empty. To appear as ghosts and to have
mechanical energy, spirits may be invested with “soul-stuff”
as a spiritual body; but this is only subtle matter.
Their own substance must be correlative with their proper
attributes as pure conscious beings, the very opposite of
bodies; and, therefore, immaterial, unextended, simple,
self-identical, according to the “paralogisms of Rational
Psychology.” But such speculations are confined to philosophers
and theologians: some of whom, however, maintain
(as if reverting to the original savage idea) that spirit is the
true substance of material things, at least that material
things depend upon a spirit, or spirits, for their existence.
Monists, again, say there is one substance of both matter
and mind, which is not either of these any more than
it is the other. Locke very honestly calls it “a supposed
I know not what.”</p>

<p>In writing of Magic, I have indicated the origin of the
notion of force; and if my view is justifiable, it appears that
those celebrated abstractions “force” and “matter,” form
and substance, spirit and body, may be traced to the savage
mind. That savages are incapable of general and abstract
ideas we have seen to be an illusion. They are necessary
to economy in the organisation of the mind. When a tribe
bases its grammatical gender on the distinction of Animate
and Inanimate, has it in no sense corresponding ideas? But
an abstract idea results from a long process of dissociative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
growth from its concrete sources, and must exist in some
manner at all stages of that growth, before its distinctness
is completed by an appropriate name; and it is reasonable
to suppose that at every stage of growth it functions and
influences the course of thought. Accordingly, it is plain
that from very early times thought has been greatly influenced
by ideas of force, form, spirit and the rest of them.</p>


<h3><a id="ch05_06"></a>§ 6. Ghosts and Spirits</h3>

<p>Whilst of some tribes (for example the Indians of Guiana)
it is said that there is nothing to indicate that they “know
of any spirits, except such as are, or once were, situated in
material bodies,”<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> amongst others we are often told that not
only ghosts are known but also spirits that are declared
never to have been incarnate. An extreme form of the
ghost-theory maintains that all spirits were once ghosts
whose incarnation has been forgotten; but this is needless,
and seems not to be true. It is enough that probably the
original inhabitants of the spirit-world were ghosts; that
some of those now believed not to have been ghosts were
once really so; and that those spirits that were never ghosts
are later immigrants, who have obtained domicile by having
been imagined in analogy with ghosts. The following list
indicates more or less probable reasons why (<i>A</i>) ghosts have
sometimes come to be regarded as non-human spirits, and
(<i>B</i>) why certain non-human things have come to be regarded
as spirits, or as possessed by spirits, more or less resembling
the human.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Spirits that were formerly ghosts, but are now declared
not to have been:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Ghosts whose former life has been forgotten by mere
lapse of time. The memory of the dead amongst many
tribes does not extend beyond three or four generations.
If then the ghost of some unusually impressive personality
happens to be remembered, when all his relatives and contemporaries
have been forgotten, he seems to be separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
from the human race. And if his name was that of some
natural object, his ghost, according to Spencer’s hypothesis,
may now be regarded as the spirit of that phenomenon.
But as to Spencer’s hypothesis,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> although it gives such a
plausible explanation of much nature-worship by real facts
as to the working of savage language and thought that it
seems to me unreasonable to doubt that it has had some of
the effects he traces to it, yet it presses upon me more and
more that most cases of nature-worship are to be explained
by more particular causes.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To dissociate a ghost from mankind is especially easy
if his tomb has been forgotten, or if he has no tomb. As the
drowned have no tombs, they easily become water-demons.
Tombs must often be forgotten in consequence of migrations.
In Central Melanesia both ghosts and spirits are recognised;
but in the west worship is directed chiefly to ghosts, in the
east chiefly to spirits. As migration has been from west to
east, the tombs of ancestors can no longer be pointed out
by the eastern islanders, and so their ghosts may have become
spirits. In Tumloo (northern New Guinea) there are temples
of spirits (all female) distinct from ancestral ghosts, and on
the banisters of ladders leading up to these temples there
are ornamental figures of ape-like animals; the architecture
of the temples points to a former superior culture.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> As there
are no apes in New Guinea, these figures and temples may
indicate a former residence under better conditions in Java
or Borneo; and the spirits with which they are associated
may be ancestral ghosts whose tombs and other earthly
vestiges have been forgotten in the migration.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) We may see another way in which a ghost may become
a pure spirit, if we suppose that as a ghost he had attained
to some measure of worship, but that with the rise of new
gods (by conquest, or by the reputation of being more
helpful), or by his being himself too good to be worth worshipping,
his rites have been neglected and his legend forgotten.
Then he is no longer remembered as a ghost, or
ancestor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) It may be thought honourable to a god to deny that he
was ever a man.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The construction of a world-myth makes it necessary
to begin somewhere with some one; and whoever becomes
the first being, it is necessary to deny that he was ever begotten.
But there may be inconsistent stories: the supreme
being of the central Esquimo is a woman, Sedna, who created
all things that have life; but other traditions give her a
human origin.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Similarly, in drawing up the genealogy of
ancestral gods, we come at last to one who was never begotten.
Such is Unkulunkulu of the Zulus, generally said to have
sprung from a bed of reeds.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p><i>B.</i> Spirits that were never incarnate, but have been
imagined by analogy with ghosts already propitiated:</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) A Totem may become a spirit; whilst, having himself
no human antecedents, he can hardly be a ghost as of an
ordinary mortal. Nothing can be more irregular than the
life of Totemism: with some tribes it seems to die out early,
or leaves few and doubtful vestiges; with others traces of it
seem to remain even amidst conditions of high culture.
Apparently, where it survives, the Totem tends gradually to
lose his bestial or vegetal properties, or most of them, and
to become an anthropomorphic spirit with his myths, in
analogy with heroic or patriarchal ancestors. He has
attained to a considerable degree of individuality; yet, by
association and tradition, may still confer more or less
sacredness upon his animal kindred (cf. <a href="#ch09_08">chap. ix. § 8</a>).</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) To address any object with a spell, as a man is addressed
in summons or command, is (as said above) an approach
toward its personification. Hence corn, rice, padi, nkasa,
or whatever has been the object of tribal rites and spells—the
sun and moon, the earth, fire, wind, clouds and rain—having
perhaps long been influenced and reinforced by
Magic—are apt, when Animism has gained control of man’s
imagination, to become first the embodiment and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
possession of spirits; the spells become prayers, and the
rites religious ceremonies or mysteries. Such spirits, at
first locally honoured, may with the evolution of the tribe or
nation, the increasing intercourse of its villages, and the
centralisation of its culture in some city, be released from
local conditions and generalised into transcendent gods,
either each of its own kind—corn or wine—or of still wider
sway over agriculture or the weather. The meteorological
gods are not impaired in strength by even wide migrations;
for they are found to rule everywhere; and this may be a
reason of their predominance in the higher religions. Plants
from which intoxicants are obtained, such as soma or the
vine, bringing men to a condition resembling insanity or the
ravings of a sorcerer who is supposed to be possessed, are
especially easy to understand as sources of inspiration.
A belief in vegetation spirits, having originated in any
way, may be extended according to the circumstances and
mentality of a tribe, until every wood is populous with
dryads.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) Natural objects that have, at first, been regarded with
awe and therefore endowed with magical powers—mountain-tops,
ravines, whirlpools, ancient trees—under Animism,
become the abode of spirits; and these, again, may, by analogy
with others, cease to be conceived as merely local. Among
the Moors, “the <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">jnūn</i>, which form a special race of beings
created before Adam, are generally supposed to be active
on occasions or in places which give rise to superstitious fear,
and in many cases they are personifications of some mysterious
qualities in persons or lifeless objects.”<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>In each of these cases, (<i>f</i>), (<i>g</i>), (<i>h</i>), however, an Euhemerist
explanation may be offered. As to (<i>f</i>), Spencer, of course,
argued that the Totem-ancestor is always a man, who bore
the name of an animal, and was confounded with it after
death; and Dr. Rivers has suggested that some gods who
seem to have been derived from Totems may really represent
heroes who had such Totems.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> As to (<i>g</i>), Grant Allen
suggested that the spirit of the corn or vine is always at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the spirit of the man upon whose grave the plant grew.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
And as to (<i>h</i>), the spirit of a mountain may be the ghost of
a man who was buried on the top of it; and the spirit of a
whirlpool the ghost of a man who was drowned in it. Indeed
some spirits may have originated in one of these ways, others
in another way; and what happened in any particular case
can only be determined, if at all, by examination of its
particular circumstances.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) Abstract ideas may, at a very early stage of culture,
be personified and treated as spirits. The Semang, according
to Messrs. Skeat and Blagden, personify Death, Hunger,
Disease;<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and the Beloki, according to the Rev. J.&nbsp;H.
Weeks, attribute all personal qualities to the aid of spirits;
so that if one man wrestles better than another, it is because
the spirit Embanda is in him.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> The modern Greeks of Macedonia
personify and propitiate Lady Small Pox.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> In the
tenth and latest book of the <cite>Rigveda</cite>, “the deification of
purely abstract ideas, such as Wrath and Faith, appears for
the first time.”<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> At a higher stage of culture we find Fides,
Fortuna, Concordia and many others. Such things are conceived
of as mysterious powers, and they have names;
and so far they resemble demons. Why, then, should they
not be personified and propitiated like demons?</p>

<p>(<i>j</i>) Various ways have been pointed out in which the
grammatical structures of language, metaphors and other
figures of speech may influence the growth of mythology.</p>

<p>(<i>k</i>) Animism having been generally adopted, spirits may
be freely invented in explanatory myths. The Kalinis believe
that thunder and lightning are the clang and flash of bracelets
on the arms of Kidilumai, a girl who dances in heaven, as
formerly on earth, for joy of the welcome rain.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> It would be
absurd to suppose that she must once have lived on earth.
Some amongst the Ekoi say that Thunder is a giant marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
across the sky; others that Thunder is the enemy of Lightning
and, on seeing it, growls to drive it away.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> If free invention
may originate myths, it may modify old ones, with results
that cannot always be interpreted upon general principles.</p>

<p>Finally, any spirits that have been anthropomorphised in
analogy with ancestor-ghosts may be further disguised by
giving them mythical family connections with the ancestors
and with one another, as happened to Bacchus and Demeter.</p>


<h3><a id="ch05_07"></a>§ 7. How Ghosts and Spirits are imagined</h3>

<p>Ghosts and spirits have the same qualities and characters,
eat the same food, appear in dreams, possess men and animals,
help sorcerers, give diseases, determine the success of hunting
or agriculture. At first, they are solid things, not truly
incorporeal, merely invisible to ordinary people by daylight;
though dogs or pigs may see them even then. A ghost is so
associated with its corpse, that it is not always clear which
it is that escapes from the grave and walks; and one may
judge whether a dead man has yet gone to Hades or still
haunts the neighbourhood, by observing whether in the
morning there are footprints around his grave; and to keep
the ghost from walking, one may fill the belly of the corpse
with stones, or break its limbs, or bury it deep and pile the
earth upon it; or one may burn it. In South-East Australia,
ghosts can be heard at night jumping down from the trees
or from the sky.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> They may be heard to speak or sing,
usually with thin voices, like bats: as</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">“the sheeted dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did squeak and gibber in the streets of Rome.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Spirits may have all the appurtenances of an animal body;
for two of them waylaid an Australian, and made a wizard
of him by taking out his entrails and filling up the cavity
with the entrails of one of themselves.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> They may marry
mortals, as a devil begat Caliban upon a witch; and not
long ago the “incubus” was very troublesome throughout
Europe. In short, a ghost or spirit can act physically, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
as a man can, because he has the same organs; but with
greater power, because mysterious and more feared. And
such beliefs persist amongst people whose culture is much
higher than the Australian, as in Jacob’s wrestling with
something at the ford Jabbok, and Grettir’s slaying of the
ghost of Glam at Thorhallstad;<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and Euthymus, the boxer,
having put on his armour, defeated the ghost of Lycas at
Temesa.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> To this day, in Macedonia, there are vampires,
or animated corpses (chiefly Turks), that walk, and throttle
people and suck their blood.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> “The Moslem corpse,” says
R. Burton, “is partly sentient in the tomb.”<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> The Karok
of California consider it the highest crime to utter the name
of the dead; for it makes the mouldering skeleton turn in its
grave and groan.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> In fact, it is difficult to think of one’s
own future corpse as entirely inanimate, and this adds some
discomfort to one’s thoughts of death. According to Wundt,
the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Körperseele</span>, as <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">eine Eigenschaft des lebenden Körpers</span>,
is a starting-point of Animism independent of, and probably
prior to, the breath and the dream, which suggest the idea
of a free separable soul.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> This confusion of ideas in popular
Animism seems to me due to (1) the strong association of
the ghost with the corpse, and the performance of rites
(which must take place somewhere, if at all) naturally at
the grave or in connection with relics; (2) the manifestation
of ghosts as visible, speaking, tangible bodies in dreams;
(3) the difficulty of imagining spirits to live and act except
in the likeness of the body (though non-human forms—usually
animal—are sometimes substituted); (4) the convenience
of such imaginations to the story-teller; (5) the convenience
of them to sorcerers and purveyors of mysteries, who rely
upon such imaginations in producing illusion by suggestion.
For ages a confusion of ghost with corpse may exist in the
popular mind along with the more refined notion of soul-stuff
in which a ghost becomes manifest, whilst there is no
attempt to reconcile these imaginations; and it is only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
metaphysical subtilties about “mind” and “matter,” or
by mystical aversion to sensuosity, that the notion of pure
incorporeal spirit without even spatial limitations is at last
freed from these primitive associations, partially and amongst
a few people. A tendency to abstract conception of the
spirit is set up, indeed, in the ordinary way of “dissociation”
by the belief in transmigration. For if a spirit may “possess”
all sorts of bodies—men, plants, animals, etc.—it is independent
of any particular body; though it may still be
thought to need <em>some</em> body. Where the idea of pure spirit
has been established amongst educated people, it becomes
necessary for those who believe in ghosts and have forgotten
their soul-stuff to explain how a spirit can manifest itself to
eye, ear, nose, hand, without a physical body, by “materialising”
itself, as invisible vapour (say one’s own breath on a
frosty morning) condenses into a cloud or into dew; for
the power of analogy as an aid to thought, or as a substitute
for it, is not yet exhausted.</p>

<p>The varieties of belief that occur here and there in the
world cannot be explained without a much fuller knowledge
of local circumstances than is usually available. The Semang
say that souls are red, like blood, and no bigger than a grain
of maize;<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> the Malays that they are vapoury, shadowy,
filmy essences, about as big as one’s thumb;<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> in both cases
shaped like the owner. Elsewhere in the Indian Archipelago,
“the animating principle is conceived of, not as a tiny being
confined to a single part of the body, but as a sort of fluid
or ether diffused through every part.”<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The less educated
classes in Japan consider the soul as a small, round, black
thing that can leave the body during sleep.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Amongst the
Ekoi, the soul is a small thing dwelling in the breast, whilst
a man lives; but at death expands into the body’s full
stature.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> The difficulty of finding the soul in the body leads
some thinkers to suppose it must be very small, others very
attenuated—thin as a shadow and as breath invisible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst many savages believe, like ourselves, that the body
entertains one soul and gives up one ghost, the Ekoi believe
in two, one animating a man’s body, the other possessing,
or changing into, some animal in the bush. Three souls, the
vegetative, sensitive and rational, are well known to European
philosophy. The Mandans thought that a man has one black,
one brown, and one light-coloured soul; but that only the
last returned to the Lord of Life.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The observer who tells
us this also reports (p. 484) that some of the Dakotas assign
to each man four spirits: one that dies with the body; one
that remains with, or near, it; one that accounts for its deeds
and at death goes to the spirit-world; and one that lingers
with the small bundle of the deceased’s hair, which is kept by
relatives until they can throw it into an enemy’s country to
become a roving, hostile demon. In West Africa, too, Miss
Kingsley found four souls: one that survives the body; one
that lives with some animal in the bush; one, the body’s
shadow, that lies down every night in the shadow of the
great god, and there recovers its strength; and, finally, the
dream-soul. Some natives hold that the three last are
functions of the first or true soul; but the witch-doctor treats
all four separately.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The shadow of a man, his reflection,
his name, his totem, his breath, his dream-wraith, his blood,
his corpse, supply natural starting-points for such speculations.
Some Chinese philosophers held that “each of the
five viscera has its own separate male soul.”<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> I have found
no belief in six souls; but in Siberia the Altaians distinguish
six parts or (rather) conditions or stages of the soul; and
this probably is only another attempt to convey the same
meaning.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Mr. Skeat reports that, probably, in the old
Animism of the Malays, each man had seven souls; though
now they talk of only one; except in using spells, when the
souls are addressed separately.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> In the religion of Osiris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
there seems to have been a still greater number of souls:
as of the name, the shape, the strength, the shadow, etc.:
all reuniting with the immortal counterpart of a man’s
mummy, if justified at the last judgment. Prof. Wiedemann
suggests that these beliefs may have been collected from
different local sources, and preserved for fear of losing anything
that might be true.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Whereas, then, the prescientific
mind is often accused of confusing things that are separate,
we see here the opposite tendency to reify abstract aspects,
and to separate things that are in nature united; and one
probable cause of this is the practical interest of treating,
and therefore of attending to and addressing, separately,
certain aspects of a man in rites of exorcism, lustration,
summoning, reinforcing, propitiation.</p>

<p>The belief in an external soul that exists apart from oneself
(though identified with oneself for good or evil) in an animal,
in the bush, or where not, may have arisen from the connecting
of the soul with the shadow or reflection. The
shadow is, indeed, attached to a man by the feet (except
when he leaps), if the whole is seen; but it goes away at
night: it stretches, as the sun declines, far across the plain,
and then disappears. The reflection is quite separate, and
is seen <em>within</em> a pool (as in a mirror), not on the surface,
approaching us when we advance, and withdrawing when we
retire: whence it is easy to understand that to take a man’s
photograph may be to take away his soul. If this kind of
soul may be some feet distant, why may it not be much
further off, if there be any motive (such as the desire of
secrecy) to wish or think it so? If it may reside within
a pool, why not within anything else? What, in fact, becomes
of it when we turn away? That it should be in an animal
in the bush is reasonable enough, if one’s Totem (even though
imperfectly remembered as such) is an animal in the bush,
and if oneself is in some sort that animal.</p>

<h3><a id="ch05_08"></a>§ 8. Origin and Destiny of Souls</h3>

<p>Beliefs as to the origin of souls sometimes bear the character
of fanciful explanation myths. The Semang say that souls
grow upon a soul-tree in the world of Kari (their chief god);
whence they are brought by birds, which are killed and eaten
by an expectant mother: souls of fishes and animals are also
obtained by the mothers’ eating certain fungi and grasses.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
Here the analogy of the growth of fruits is adopted: being
so familiar as to need no further explanation. Leibnitz’s
suggestion that monads are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fulgurations continuelles de la
Divinité</i>,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> is at about the same level of thought. In other
cases, we see the struggling to birth of ideas that still seem
plausible: such is the widespread tenet that every present
human soul is the reincarnation of an ancestor, which we find
in Australia, Melanesia, Borneo, Manipur, on the Congo, in
North America and elsewhere. The Bakongo seem to base
their belief in reincarnation partly on personal resemblance;
upon which ground a child may be thought to have the soul
even of a living man; so that to point out such a resemblance
is displeasing, since it implies that, the child having his soul,
he must soon die.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Another reason they give for their belief
is that the child speaks early of things its mother has not
taught it, and that this must be due to an old soul talking
in a new body. But Bakongo albinos are incarnations of
water-spirits, and greatly feared. Possibly in some cases
people began by naming children after their ancestors, and
later inferred that those who bore the same name must be
the same persons. Plato thought that, by a sort of law of
psychic conservation, there must always be the same number
of souls in the world:<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> there must, therefore, be reincarnation.
That nothing absolutely begins to be, or perishes,
though first explicit in the Ionian philosophy, is generally
assumed in savage thinking; so why should it not be true of
souls?</p>

<p>As to the destiny of souls there seems to exist amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
tribes of men even greater variety of belief than as to their
origin. They may pass through more than one stage of
development: as in the western isles of Torres Straits one
becomes at death, first a <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">mari</i>, and later a <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">markai</i> with a more
definite status;<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> or as with the Veddas, one is at first called,
without much confidence, “the living one,” and only a few
days later becomes, after trial of one’s virtue, a <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">yaka</i>,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> or
authentic ghost. Often the dead will be reincarnated, but
the interval between death and rebirth may be passed in an
underworld, or in a city in the forest, or indefinitely in a land
of ancestors. They may turn into plants; as among the
Mafulu old people’s ghosts become large funguses growing
in the mountains:<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> but more frequently into animals;
perhaps their Totems, or (with seeming caprice) into such
things as termites or wild pigs; or (because wings seem to
suit the spirit) into a butterfly or bee; or into owls or bats
that haunt the night and dwell in caves that may be tombs;
or into deer or bear-cats, because these are seen in the clearings
near tombs; or into snakes, because these are seen to come
out of tombs, and often come into huts as if returning to
their homes, and, moreover, cast their skins and so typify
the renewal of life. They may also become stars, or shooting
stars, or mere naked demons, or white men.</p>

<p>It is only after ages of thought concerning the fate of our
souls that there arises in any systematic form the doctrine
of metempsychosis, which now prevails over great part of
southern and eastern Asia, and was formerly known in Egypt
and even in Greece. But in the widely diffused doctrines
of reincarnation in men or in animals, or even in plants, and
in the general belief that a soul may wander and possess
any kind of body, we see the sources from which this vast
flood of superstition collected its waters. The Buddhist
belief that not the soul wanders, but its <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">karma</i> (or character)
creates a new body, may be considered as a retrogression
from Animism to Magic; for what is it but a law of the
action of an occult force or virtue?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the ghost survive the body, and it may be said
(as by the Ekoi) that it cannot perish, and the reason may
even be given (as in the Bismarck Archipelago), that it is of
different nature from the body,<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> it is by no means always
immortal. It may die, as it were a natural death, by
oblivion; or, the next world being just like this, ghosts may
fight together and kill one another;<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> according to the Tongans
a ghost may be killed with a club; amongst the Bakongo it
may be destroyed by burning its corpse.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> It has been
thought that to suppress the ghost was the original motive of
cremation; but the western Tasmanians cremated their
dead, and can hardly have done so to be rid of such mild
Animism as seems to have been entertained by the eastern
tribes, who buried their dead or abandoned them.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> However,
they seem to have been rid of it; whereas, in general,
ghosts survive cremation, because this process cannot put
an end to dreams; and it may then come to be believed
that burning is necessary in order to set the soul free from its
body; and, therefore, the wife of Periander, tyrant of Corinth,
complained to him of being cold in the ghost world, because
her clothes had been only buried in her tomb and not burnt.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
According to the Egyptians, the ghost participated in every
mutilation of the body, and perished with its dissolution.
It may be held that even the gods die if neglected, and depend
for their immortality upon the perpetuation of their rites and
sacrifices.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Whilst the ghost’s life endures, its dwelling may be in the
earth or sky, sea or forest, or in the land of the setting sun,
or in the land of ancestors whence the tribe remembers to
have migrated. Before departing to that undiscovered
country, it may haunt the grave or the old home, till burial,
or till the flesh decays, or till the funeral feast, or till death
has been avenged; or it may roam the country, a resentful
demon, if its funeral rites be not duly celebrated. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
may be one place for all ghosts, or two, or more, according
to their age, or rank, or qualities (as sociable or unsociable),
or whether or not their noses were bored; or according to
the manner of their death, by violence, or suicide, or sorcery.
It is late before our posthumous destiny is thought to depend
on moral character (as it does in metempsychosis); and even
then varies with the local conception of the good man, as
observing custom or religious rites or, finally, the dictates
of conscience.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> I remember how puzzling it was in childhood
to make out from sermons how far “going to heaven”
depended on being good (conscientious) or on faith. Both
seemed very desirable; yet there was a shadow of opposition
between them, and to be good was a little dangerous. But
faith was indispensable, and apparently the more difficult
of the two, needing more elucidation, exhortation and
reiteration.</p>

<p>The journey of ghosts to their own world may be short
or long, an unadorned migration or rich in details of adventure.
They may begin the new life exactly as they finished
this one, or the old may be rejuvenated. As to their manner
of life there, oftenest it is a repetition of their earthly state,
perhaps better, or even much better, perhaps worse. And
this conception is historically of the utmost importance:
for (1) it seems to give the greatest confidence in a hereafter.
Hume ascribes what seemed to him the incredulity of men
with regard to a future life “to the faint idea we form of
our future condition, derived from its want of resemblance
to the present life.”<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> And (2) from this conception proceeds
the development of ghostly polities: presided over, according
to tribes that have no chiefs, by a headman, such as Damarulum,
or by the greatest known hunt-leader, like Kande
Yaka of the Veddas; under advancing political structures,
by chieftains, amongst whom one may be paramount, and
so become a king or lord of all. These ghostly politics support
the earthly ones they imitate. It is everywhere an edifice
built by hope and fear, under the guidance of analogy, and
sometimes decorated by caprice, if this find acceptance with
the tribe.</p>

<h3><a id="ch05_09"></a>§ 9. The Treatment of Ghosts</h3>

<p>The behaviour of men toward the ghosts of their dead is
chiefly governed by fear. The human power that has left
the corpse is now invisible; that power, rarely quite trustworthy
whilst in the body, especially when unobserved,
retains its desires, caprices and hatreds that were partially
controlled by social influences. What controls them now
that the man is exempt from observation? How shall one
defend oneself against him, or procure his neutrality, or even
(as sometimes in the flesh) his help? The fear of ghosts has
peculiar qualities: the invisibility of a spiritual enemy
produces a general objectless suspicion and a sense of helplessness;
associations with the physical conditions of the corpse
and with darkness excite feelings very much like those
aroused by snakes and reptiles. This fear explains why
savages, such as the Australians, may believe in ghosts for
ages without ever venturing to pray even to father or mother
deceased; for to pray is to invoke, and they will come, and,
on the whole, they are not wanted. Fear may make the
survivors quit the neighbourhood of the dead; sometimes
makes them adopt means to induce the ghost to leave, and
invent stories of how and whither he goes, which are believed
by biological necessity; because, unless they can be rid of
the ghost and the dread of him, or establish in some way the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pax deorum</i>, it is impossible to go on living.</p>

<p>The Yerkla-mining never bury their dead, nor in any way
dispose of them. On seeing death approaching a tribesman,
they make up a good fire for him, and leave the neighbourhood,
not to return for a considerable time.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The Sakai,
having buried the dead affectionately with necklaces, wallets,
etc., say to him: “Do not remember any more your father,
mother, or relations. Think only of your ancestors gone
to another place. Your living friends will find food.” They
then burn his house and desert the settlement, even abandoning
standing crops.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Among the Kikuyu, “if a person dies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in a village, that village is often burnt, and the people trek
off and build elsewhere,” though much labour may have
been spent on the surrounding fields. Sick people are often
deserted.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Where land is closely settled such flight becomes
impossible, and in any case it is very inconvenient; so that
if any one can believe it possible to deceive the ghost, or to
frighten him away by shouting at him, beating the air with
boughs or firebrands, letting off arrows or guns, or to restrain
him from walking by breaking the corpse’s legs, or by placing
loaded “ghost-shooters” (straws filled with gunpowder)
around the grave, so much the better. Many such plans are
adopted, and they <em>must</em> be believed in.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Affection, however, has its part in the treatment of the
dead: it is reasonable to attribute to affection the beginnings
of the practices of leaving food at the tomb, burying weapons
or ornaments with the corpse, celebrating funerary rites with
lamentations; though in time this motive may be mixed with,
or superseded by, fear of the ghost, or by fear of being suspected
of having murdered the deceased by sorcery, should
rites be neglected or maimed. It is not uncommon to carry
about some bones of the departed, to hang round one’s neck
the skulls of infants untimely dead. The wild Veddas,
though, having covered a corpse with boughs, they avoid
the place for a long time for fear of being stoned, nevertheless
have a strong feeling of good fellowship for the spirits of
their dead.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> In the eastern isles of Torres Straits, the Miriam
perform an eschatological mystery, in which the recently
deceased reappear on their way to the other world. The
women and children take it for reality: their affections are
said to be gratified; and at the same time their fears are
allayed by the conviction that the ghosts, having been seen
on their way to Hades, will no longer haunt them.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
old Norsemen believed that the dead were still united with
the living by intense sympathy.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> As rites begun in affection
may become propitiatory through fear, and after prayer has
been instituted may be further extended to obtain the aid
of spirits or gods in hunting, war, revenge, love, agriculture,
trade, or any undertaking for subsistence, riches or power,
every passion in turn seeks its gratification through Animism.</p>

<p>Extravagance in funerary rites, often ruinous to the family,
may sometimes be checked by considerations of economy or
convenience. Thus some tribes of South Australia may burn
all the property of the deceased except their stone axes,
which are too valuable to be lost to the survivors. The
Nagas bury with the body the things most closely associated
with the dead; but things of small value, never the gun or
the cornelian necklace.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The Todas, who burn their dead,
lay the body on a bier with many valuable offerings and
swing it three times over the fire; they then remove the
money and the more valuable ornaments and burn the rest
with the corpse. They say that the dead still have the use
of everything that was swung over the fire; and tell a story
to explain the ceremony; but Dr. Rivers observes that
“this symbolic burning has the great advantage that the
objects of value are not consumed, and are available for use
another time.”<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The Araucanians buried many things with
the dead, and at the grave of a chief slew a horse. But for
all valuables—silver spurs and bits and steel lance-heads—they
left wooden substitutes. As for the horse, the mourners
ate it, and the ghost got nothing but the skin and the soul
of it.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Economy may also induce the belief that ghosts are
easily deceived, or are unaccountably stupid in some special
way: as in the widespread practice of carrying a corpse
out of its house through a hole in the wall; trusting that,
the hole having been immediately repaired, the ghost can
never find his way back; so soon does he forget the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
door. This is cheaper than to burn the house down. Superstitious
practices may be carried out with self-destructive
infatuation, or restricted at will: in Florida (Melanesia),
in a certain stream, a very large eel was taken for a ghost;
no one might bathe in, or drink at, the stream—“except at
one pool, which for convenience was considered not to be
sacred.”<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> A conflicting desire creates a limiting belief.
Whilst often the most painful or disgusting rites are endured
for fear of ghosts, at other times they are assumed to be so
dull that we are tempted to say: “Whatever is convenient
is credible.”</p>

<p>If we desire to know the future, ghosts are so wise that
we consult their oracles and pay handsome fees to their
inspired priests; but if we dread their presence, it is easy to
accept any suggestion that they are obtuse or infatuated.
They may (<abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>) be afflicted with what psychiatrists call
“arithmomania.” Returning from a funeral, strew the
ground with millet-seed: then the ghost can never overtake
you, for he must stop to count them. Or hang a sieve
outside your window: he cannot enter until he has counted
all the holes; moreover, his system of numeration does not
reach beyond “two.” You can always block his path by
drawing a line across it and pretending to jump over the
line as if it were a stream of water: of course, he cannot
pass that. Or blaze through the wood a circular trail,
beginning at his grave and returning to it: he must follow it
around for ever, always ending at the same cold grave.
Alas, poor thin, shivering thing, that would go back to the
old hearth and sit close amongst the kinsmen by the fire,
and laugh at the old jokes and listen to the old stories—chiefly
about ghosts—have you forgotten all the tricks that can
be played upon your kind? Such is the homœopathy of
superstition: imagination creates the fear of ghosts, and
imagination cures it.</p>

<p>Imagination-beliefs, being swayed by moods and passions,
are necessarily inconsistent. Natives of the Bismarck Archipelago
are cannibals and greatly fear the ghosts of those
they devour. Whilst feasting they hang up a slice for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
ghost himself, and afterwards make an uproar to scare him
away. Nevertheless they keep his skull and jawbone, which
the ghost might be supposed especially to haunt; so easily
do other passions overcome fear. Of the fear of ghosts sometimes
seems true that which Bacon says of the fear of death,
that there is no passion in the mind of man so weak but it
mates and masters it. Sacrilegious miscreants have always
robbed tombs, even the tombs of Pharaohs who were gods;
and timid lovers have kept tryst in graveyards. The Sia
Indians of North Mexico had a masterful way of dealing with
the ghost of a slain enemy: they annexed him together with
his scalp; for this having been brought to the village, a
shaman offered a long prayer, and thus addressed the ghost:
“You are now no longer an enemy; your scalp is here;
you will no more destroy my people.”<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> To capture and
enslave the ghost of an enemy is said to have been the chief
motive of head-hunting in Malaya. Compare the conduct of
the Romans in carrying off Juno from Veii and establishing
her at Rome. The inconsistency (sometimes met with) of
supposing a man’s personal qualities to go with his ghost,
and yet eating some part of his body to obtain those qualities,
may be due to the latter practice having been magical, and
having persisted after the rise of Animism. Some of the
Esquimo have such control over ghosts by Magic, that they
fear them very little. After a death, the ghost remains
peaceably in the house four days (if a man) or five (if a
woman), and is then dismissed by a ceremony to the grave,
to wait there until a child is born in the village, when it is
recalled to be the child’s tutelary spirit.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>


<h3><a id="ch05_10"></a>§ 10. Evolution and Dissolution of Animism</h3>

<p>Animism, originating in the belief in ghosts of men, tends
to spread as the explanation of whatever had formerly been
attributed to Magic (if we take this to have been earlier);
although it is far from occupying the whole region that thus
lies open to it. We have seen that the extent of its prevalence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
as an explanatory principle, and consequently as the basis of
cults, differs greatly amongst different peoples. But more
interesting than the spread of belief as to the agency of
spirits so as to include more and more objects, is the gradual
differentiation of some of them from common ghosts in
power, character and rank, and their integration into families
and polities, such as we see in the <cite>Edda</cite> and the <cite>Iliad</cite>. A
process, going on for ages and varying with every people,
cannot be briefly described: the work of E.&nbsp;B. Tylor, Herbert
Spencer, W. Wundt and others in this department is well
known. In general it may be said that, allowing for the
influences of geographical conditions and tradition and
foreign intercourse, the chief cause of the evolution of a spirit-world
is the political evolution of those who believe in it;
so that the patriarchies, aristocracies, monarchies and
despotisms of this world are reflected in heaven. Tribes of
the lowest culture—some African Pygmies, Fuegians, Mafulu,
Semangs, Veddas—have the least Animism; at successive
grades—Australians, Melanesians, Congolese, Amerinds, Polynesians—Animism
increases and grows more systematic;
and it culminates in the barbaric civilisations of Egypt,
Babylonia and India, and of Mexico and Peru. But in
civilisations of our modern type it rapidly loses ground.</p>

<p>The cause of such differences in the extension and elaboration
of the animistic hypothesis cannot be that some tribes
have had more time than others to think it out; since they
have all had an equally long past. Animism is known to be
very ancient, and there is no reason to think that some races
adopted it later than others. That, in the lower grades of
culture, men want brains to think it out, is not a satisfactory
explanation; because, on contact with superior races, backward
peoples show themselves capable of much more than
could have been inferred from their original state. Improvement
in culture depends upon much besides native brains,
namely, opportunities afforded by the resources of their
habitat, and communication with other peoples. The most
backward peoples are the most isolated peoples. The
development of Animism is entirely a matter of operating
with ideas; and it seems to me that before men can build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
with ideas they must build with their hands; there must be
occupations that educate, and give advantage to, constructive
power, as in the making of boats and the building of houses
and temples; for to this day a nation’s material edifices are
always, in clearness of plan, coherence and serviceableness,
much in advance of their systems of theology and philosophy;
because they must “work,” as the Pragmatists say. If you
have ever gone over a battleship, compare her with the
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kritik d. r. Vernunft</cite>. Secondly, a suitable model for the
edifice of ideas must be presented in the world of fact; and
this, as we have seen, is supplied by the tribe’s social and
political structure; which, again, is clearly correlated with
the improvement of architecture in building the houses of
chiefs and gods. Thirdly, a favourable condition of the
working out of any theory is to have the means of recording,
either in oral literature or (still better) in writing, the advances
already made; and, fourthly—a condition historically involved
in the foregoing—the growth of a class of men,
generally a priestly caste or order, sometimes poets, who have
time to think, and the education and vocation to bring the
accumulating masses of animistic—now religious—ideas into
greater order and consistency. Hence there are two stages
in the development of Animism—of course, not sharply
separated: first, a long period of irregular growth in the
tribal mind; and, secondly, a much shorter period, in which
the extension of animistic theory depends more or less upon
quasi-philosophical reflection.</p>

<p>With the differentiation of superior beings—heroic, ancestral
or other gods—from common ghosts, Religion arises.
As to the meaning of the word “religion,” indeed, there is no
agreement: some lay stress upon the importance of beliefs
concerning supernatural beings; others upon prayer, sacrifice
and other rites of worship; still others upon the emotions of
awe and mystery. To define “religion” (as a tribal institution)
by all three of these characters seems to me the most
convenient plan, and the most agreeable to common usage.
That, on the one hand, pure Buddhism (if it ever was a living
faith outside of a coterie of philosophers and saints), and,
on the other hand, the spiritual condition of a few savages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
may be wanting in one or other mark, is no serious objection.
The former case is, in fact, exceptional and aberrant, and the
latter rudimentary; not to give them the name of “religion”
in a technical sense is no wrong to anybody. Thus understood,
then, Religion brings to the development and support
of Animism many social utilities and other influences;
especially the influence of dynasties supposed to have descended
from the gods; and of priesthoods, whose sustentation
and authority depend upon the supposed necessity of
their intervention in worship. In their hands the free popular
development of animistic ideas comes to an end, and gives
place to the co-ordination of ideas by reflection, and to the
dictation of tenets and rites by policy. The simple motives
of hope and fear that actuated popular Animism are now
supplemented by dynastic and priestly interests and ambitions;
beneath which lies, faintly recognised and ill served,
the interest of society in order.</p>

<p>This later sophisticated Animism, so far as it obtains a
hold upon the people, is imposed upon them by suggestion,
authority and deception; but being superimposed upon
ancient popular traditions that are never obliterated, it
still appeals to the sentiments of awe, consolation, hope and
enthusiastic devotion. The part of deception in the history
of Animism, indeed, begins at the beginning, preceded,
perhaps, and prepared for by the devices of Magic-mongers.
Amongst the Arunta, women and children are taught that
the noise of the bull-roarer during initiation ceremonies is
the voice of the spirit Twanyirika.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Near Samoa Harbour,
at harvest, they offer some of the firstfruits in a bowl to the
ghosts; and, whilst the family feasts on the remainder,
“the householder will surreptitiously stir the offerings in the
bowl with his finger, and then show it to the others in proof
that the souls of the dead have really partaken.”<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> So early
is the end supposed to justify the means. Animism, like
Magic, strives to maintain its imaginations by further stimulating
the imagination; and, in both cases, such practices are,
with many men, compatible with firm belief on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the practitioner; who is merely anxious to promote the public
good by confirming the weaker brethren: himself weak in
the perception of incongruities. But I am concerned chiefly
with origins, and will pursue this nauseous topic no further.</p>

<p>Parallel with the development of Religion, a change takes
place in the emotions connected with Animism. As the gods
emerge from the shadow of night and the grave, and are
cleansed from the savour of corruption, and withdraw to
the summit of the world, they are no longer regarded with the
shuddering fear that ghosts excite; as they acquire the
rank of chiefs and kings, the sentiments of attachment, awe,
duty, dependence, loyalty, proper to the service of such
superiors, are directed to them; and since their power far
exceeds that of kings, and implies the total dependence of
man and nature upon their support and guidance, these sentiments—often
amazingly strong toward earthly rulers—may
toward the gods attain to the intensest heat of fanaticism.
Extolled by priests and poets, the attributes of the gods are
exaggerated, until difficulties occur to a reflective mind as to
how any other powers can exist contrary to, or even apart
from, them: so that philosophical problems arise as to the
existence of evil and responsibility, and the doctors reason
<span class="nobreak">high—</span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">“Of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find no end, in wandering mazes lost.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is one cause of the dissolution of Animism: the power
that comprehends all powers ceases to be an object, and
becomes the immanence of all things, good and evil. Another
cause is the complexity of theogonies, or of spiritual kingdoms
with their orders and degrees: found too fanciful, when
hierarchic despotisms, that furnished the analogues, give
place to the simpler social structure of democracies; or, to
a certain type of democrat, even insulting, a provocative
disparagement of the sovereignty of the people. And
Animism has other enemies in the growth of Positivism, and
sometimes in the resurgence of Magic.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<br />THE RELATIONS BETWEEN MAGIC AND ANIMISM</h2>


<h3><a id="ch06_01"></a>§ 1. The Question of Priority</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Magic</span> and Animism now everywhere flourish side by side,
or in confused association, and, by those who believe in them,
are not discriminated as they may be by a spectator. As to
their origin, we have seen that both of them are prehistoric;
it is useless to inquire about it amongst believers (who can
only tell you that they learnt these things from their forefathers),
or to look for any sort of direct proof. In Chapter <abbr class="no-it" title="4"><a href="#CHAPTER_IV">IV.</a></abbr>
I mentioned general considerations in favour of the priority
of Magic; but said nothing of the opposite opinion, that
Animism is prior and Magic derivative: an opinion held by
many and, amongst them, by Wundt, whose treatment of the
problem claims attention.</p>

<p>Prof. Wundt holds that the idea of the soul is older than
Magic and has three principal sources: (1) the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">gebundene
Seele</span>, or <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Körperseele</span> (consciousness as an attribute of the
body), is immediately given, without the need of any reflection,
as a result of perception-associations; for thinking, feeling
and willing are constant elements of a living body.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> The
influence of this idea is seen in the practices of making offerings
to the dead at their tombs, of preserving the body itself, of
treating the blood and various parts of the body as vehicles
of the soul, the use of hair and nail-parings in sorcery, and so
forth. By contact, this soul can be transfused into other
things. But the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">freie Seele</span>, a being differing from and opposed
to the body, is suggested (2) by breath and by the cessation
of the body’s living functions with the last breath—the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hauchseele</span>; and also (3) by dreams and visions—the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schattenseele</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
This third conception gradually subordinates the
other two, and has the chief part in the development of Animism
and Mythology.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> As to sorcery (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zauber</span>), it is, at first,
always attributed to the human will; inasmuch as this is
the original type of causation. Ordinary events raise no
question of causes for the Naturmensch; but only extraordinary
occurrences do so, such as sickness and death. Even pain
or death from wounds is a matter of course, for the antecedents
are visible to him; but pain or death from sickness
has no such customary antecedent; so to explain them he
imagines an enemy who can operate at a distance by sorcery.
Sorcery he conceives of as an operation of one soul upon
another; either directly, or indirectly by various appliances,
such as pantomimic injury by means of an image. Pantomime
is at first believed to affect the victim’s soul, and so to cause
sickness in his body; but the oftener such rites are repeated,
the more the intervention of the soul is obscured. For in
many-linked associations, especially where the first and last
links stand as means and end, the middle links are apt to
disappear; and since these are, in this case, ideas about the
soul, there remains, after their loss, the indefinite idea of some
incomprehensible action at a distance by means of the pantomime:
it is then no longer Sorcery but Magic. Similarly,
a fetich, or a talisman or amulet (which differs from a fetich
only in not being the object of a cult), originally owes its power
to an indwelling spirit, but may degenerate into a magical
object.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Magic, therefore, is always derivative and secondary;
and Animism is entirely independent of Magic.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>This theory is worked out with Prof. Wundt’s usual
comprehensiveness and methodical clearness; and the exposition
abounds with interesting discussions; but it has not
convinced me. The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Körperseele</span>, as an attribute of the body,
is, surely, not a soul at all. Customary perception of other
men interpreted by self-consciousness, with the habitual
treatment of others (and of ourselves by others) as conscious
bodies—making it difficult to conceive that a corpse is really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
dead—no doubt influences animistic rites; for even though the
soul seen in dreams may be believed to live, having the consciousness
of its former body in dreamland, yet some consciousness
seems to remain with the body in the grave. Many
rites performed at a tomb, however, may also be understood
in relation to a belief that the soul, though having a separate
existence as seen in dreams, still desires to reinhabit its body,
or to protect its buried treasures, and therefore, though its
new home be far away, frequently returns and haunts the
neighbourhood of its tomb, and will certainly return if summoned.
But it is not until the soul seen in dreams has become
an object of popular belief, that any idea can be formed of
a body-soul—or more properly of a soul within the body, and
thence of a soul-stuff of the body—which leaves the body at
death (and under other conditions) as the vehicle of consciousness.
This soul-stuff which leaves the body at death may
easily come to be identified with the breath, but not until the
discussion of dreams has given rise to the belief in a separable
soul. The fact that in cold weather the last breath (or any
other!) may appear for a moment as a vapour, and is never
seen again, cannot by itself suggest a separate persistent
existence like that of the soul; and over a considerable part
of the earth such a vapour is seldom formed by the breath.
The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Körperseele</span> and the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hauchseele</span>, therefore, are not
independent sources of Animism, but are entirely dependent
for their imaginary existence upon the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schattenseele</span>, upon
the growth of a belief in a separable soul as seen in dreams.</p>

<p>As to Sorcery, it may be defined as Magic practised with
the aid of spirits; and since its existence implies that a belief
in spirits and their influence has already formed itself, it
may also be believed to operate, in the first place, on the souls
of its victims and so, in the second place, on their bodies.
Then, as Prof. Wundt explains, a process of retrogradation
sometimes occurs, in the course of which the spirits are
forgotten, and only the mechanical rites remain as a residuum
of bare Magic. Similarly, a fetich sometimes becomes a
merely magical talisman or amulet. This is hardly disputable;
but it does not prove that the degeneration of Sorcery
is the <em>only</em> source of Magic, or that Magic has not (for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
part, indeed,) another, independent origin. The issue is
difficult to argue upon the ground of facts, because magical
practices are of such high antiquity. If, for example, one
should urge that the intichiuma ceremonies of the Arunta are
not, so far as we have evidence, designed to operate by spiritual
power upon the souls of the emu or the witchettygrub, but
directly to promote by Magic the fertility of these objects, it
might be replied that such, indeed, may be their present
character, but that the original intention must have been to
promote fertility by first influencing their souls, and that
this has been forgotten. Or, again, if one should point to
the little stones—tied up in bark and believed by the Kaitish
to be stores of evil Magic—as having no mark of the fetich,
no character to indicate that their power is due to spirits,
so that they seem to be merely magical, the answer would
be ready, that by long use and retrogradation they may have
ceased to be fetiches, but that a good theory requires them
to have been of that nature aforetime. Thus any case of
apparently bare Magic may be treated as a residuum of lapsed
Animism; or, should its origin be recent and ascertainable,
it may still be said to have been constituted by analogy with
such residua.</p>

<p>We are driven, therefore, to rest the argument upon the
psychological conditions of such beliefs. Is the nature of
the human mind, so far as we can interpret it at the savage
level, such that the belief in Animism necessarily precedes
and (later) gives rise to the belief in Magic; or is it possible
to indicate conditions that may independently give rise to
Magic? According to Prof. Wundt, as I have said, Sorcery
precedes Magic and, at first, is always attributed to human
volition, because this is the original type of causation. Contrary
to Hume’s doctrine (he says), the ordinary course of
events does not excite in the savage the idea of causation,
or the need of explanation. Customary series of events
belong to those matter-of-course properties of things which
he, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">eben wegen ihrer Regelmässigkeit, unmöglich hinweg
denken kann</span>.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> It is the unusual occurrences—accidents,
storms, drought (where rain is much desired) and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sickness and death—that awaken in him the need of causal
explanation. He is accustomed to pain from wounds, where
he sees the conditions on which they always follow; but the
pain of disease has no such antecedents, and he supplies
the gap in routine by free associations, imagining that this
pain also must be the work of some enemy. For in the regular
course of events there is for him only one region in which an
effect appears <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">notwendig verknüpft mit dem Vorausgehende</span>:
namely, that of his own voluntary actions. The connexion
is, indeed, only a matter of fact; but it includes the sensations
and feelings of his own power <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">über den Eintritt des Ereignisses</span>.
This, as Berkeley saw (says Prof. Wundt), is the true origin
of the notion of causality; though the true principle of
causality requires the elimination of this subjective ground
of its origin.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>It is true, of course, that the savage has no definite idea of
the principle of causation; but he has obscure ideas of all
its chief marks—the need of some antecedent for every event,
regularity of connexion, and proportionality; and probably,
in the depths of his mind, the abstract principle has made
some progress toward maturity. (<i>a</i>) The ground or source of
such ideas, according to Hume, is customary experience;
and that such experience includes its own causation (and,
therefore, needs no explanation) is proved by Prof. Wundt’s
contention that it is the unusual which first demands causal
explanation; because there the familiar causation is missing;
so that the savage tries to fill up the lacuna, as best he can,
according to the type of what is usual. But (<i>b</i>), according
to Prof. Wundt, there is in the regular course of events only
one region in which the idea of causation (though illusory)
first arises: namely, our own actions, in which we are aware
of our own power over the beginning of the event. And no
one, I suppose, doubts that the notion of power is derived
originally from the consciousness of our own exertions<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>: read,
by sympathy, into the actions of other men and animals and,
by empathy, into the movements of trees, stones, winds and
waters. All this, however, occurs so early in the individual
and in the race (probably in the higher animals) that, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the need of causal explanation is felt, the world is seen as
if pervaded by forces, which are manifested in <em>every</em> usual
course of events and not merely in voluntary actions. Again
(<i>c</i>), power is only one character of the primitive belief in causation:
another, not less important, is uniformity; and the
study of our own actions is notoriously unfavourable for the
discovery of uniformity. Without any obvious reason for
it, our visceral activities can hardly be controlled at all;
compound reflexes (such as yawning, sneezing, laughing,
weeping) are very imperfectly controlled; our habitual
actions, once started, go on of themselves, and often begin
without (or contrary to) our wishes, especially gestures and
expressions; in fatigue control flags, in disease is often lost;<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
we do not always give the same weight to the same motives,
nor fulfil our intentions whether good or bad. But if the
relation of will to action is not apparently uniform, it cannot
be seen to be necessary; so that volition is generally regarded
as the peculiar region of caprice. This is very important in
Animism. But, further (<i>d</i>), were the connexion between
volition and movement more constant than it is, it would
still be most improbable that ideas of causation should be
chiefly drawn from our consciousness of it; for the interest
of action lies not in the mere control of our own movements, or
power over the beginning of events, but in the attainment of
our ends; and there is no department of nature in which
the failure of connexion is nearly so impressive. It is because
of this failure that the savage becomes fascinated by ideas
of magical and (later) of spiritual aid. Finally (<i>e</i>), no control
is exercised by the will over pain—headache, colic, rheumatism,
etc.; yet we are told that the savage, when so afflicted, refers
his sufferings at once to the will of some enemy operating
at a distance. Such inferences are not primitive, but the
result of a long growth of superstitions. Among Australian
aborigines, disease and natural death are generally believed
to be caused by the magical practices of an enemy, not merely
by his will.</p>

<p>We are not, then, obliged to infer that, because volition is
the type of necessary connexion, Sorcery, or any other form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of Animism, preceded Magic. On the other hand, there are
conditions that may have given rise independently to a belief
in Magic. The savage has frequent experience of regular
trains of event which, for want of analytic ability, he does not
clearly understand, but which exist in his mind as types
determining his apprehension of other sequences. When
two interesting events happen about the same time, the later
recalls the earlier; because the impression of the earlier,
having been deep, perseverates, and is apt to be re-excited
by almost any occurrence. An association is then formed
between them, and obtains as strong a hold upon the mind as
less interesting ones can by many repetitions. The man
judges them to be connected; and expects the coincidence
to repeat itself as usual occurrences do; and the more vividly
the more he desires or fears it. Such expectations, together
with the idea of invisible force and the oppression of mystery,
by degrees establish the belief in Magic. Probably no traveller
amongst wild peoples, or observer of the unsophisticated at
home, will think that too much stress is here laid upon the
power of coincidence to create general expectations. Even
the Chaldean priests (we are told) had grasped but imperfectly
the idea of causation. “When two events had been
noticed to happen one after another, the first was the cause
of the second. Hence their anxiety to record the phenomena
of the heavens and the occurrences that took place after
each.”<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The Egyptians, says Herodotus, “whenever a prodigy
takes place, watch and record the result; then, if anything
similar ever happens again, they expect the same consequences.”<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
They had merely reduced to a system the
universal practice of unanalytic minds.</p>


<h3><a id="ch06_02"></a>§ 2. Magic and Religion</h3>

<p>The origin of Magic, then, is independent of Animism; and
in the history of human thought Magic probably preceded
Animism as an imaginary agent in the explanation and control
of interesting and obscure events. Sir J.&nbsp;G. Frazer, in the
<cite>History of the Kingship</cite> and in the <cite>Magic Art</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> says that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Magic, as a means of gratifying one’s desires, is prior to
Religion conceived of as a means of attaining one’s ends by
the propitiation of spirits. This is a much narrower contention
than that Magic is prior to Animism (which perhaps he
does not maintain), and it is proportionally more defensible.
Whilst the priority of Magic to Animism seems to me to have
some low degree of probability, the priority of Magic to
Religion, as the propitiation of spirits, seems probable in a
much higher degree; since we have plain information that
both the Australians and the Indians of Guiana practise Magic
extensively and also believe in ghosts and spirits without
propitiating them.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Sir J. G. Frazer’s explanation of <em>how</em>
Religion superseded Magic is questionable. He conjectures
“that a tardy recognition of the inherent falsehood and
barrenness of magic set the more thoughtful part of mankind
to cast about for a truer theory of Nature and a more fruitful
method of turning her resources to account. The shrewder
intelligences must in time have come to perceive that magical
ceremonies and incantations did not really effect the results
which they were designed to produce,” and the wizard inferred
that, “if the great world went on its way without the
help of him or his fellows, it must surely be because there were
other beings, like himself, but far stronger, who, unseen
themselves, directed its course.”<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> To these he addressed
himself, and sought by prayer what he had formerly hoped to
obtain by Magic. Such is Sir J.&nbsp;G. Frazer’s suggestion,
offered tentatively, and (surely) not agreeing well with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
facts which he has set before us. For he has shown that no
amount of experience can discredit Magic, generally, in
untutored minds; that certain kinds of Magic are sometimes
pushed into the background by Religion, but never forgotten;
whilst other kinds of Magic become fused with Religion
itself and constitute an essential factor in its rites; so that
they are indeed few who can be said to have betaken themselves
to Religion <em>instead</em> of Magic. Besides, the only ground
upon which a penetrating mind, that had discarded Magic as
discredited by experience, could resort by preference to the
worship of spirits must be that experience showed prayer
and sacrifice to be more efficacious than Magic in attaining
our ends. Is there reason to think that (lucky coincidences
apart) this has ever happened? Must we not rather say that,
whether one relies on Magic or on Religion, experience of
failure counts for almost nothing? So many excuses are
at hand.</p>

<p>The matter presents itself to me in this way: at first, belief
in Magic arises as a means of obtaining good and averting evil.
Grounded, as Sir E.&nbsp;B. Tylor says,<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> in the desire “to discover,
to foretell, and to cause events,” it is irresistibly attractive
by its power of increasing one’s confidence, of making sure.</p>

<p>Secondly, at some stage after the rise of Animism, religious
practices are added to the magical, to make assurance doubly
sure, just as one magical practice may be added to another, a
rite to a spell. At this stage, there is no sense of opposition
between Magic and Religion. That, in fact, they are opposed
in their nature, as an invariable to a capricious force, even
if this difference were appreciated by savages, need not
prevent their co-operation; for Magic is known to be a tendency
that may fail of the effect desired, either by the counteraction
of superior Magic, or by imperfection in the rites; and
one sees no reason why a spirit should not be supplicated to
supplement the imperfect rites, or to frustrate the superior
Magic. To supplicate the intervention of spirits, once they
are fully believed in, is an act so simple and natural, that we
may wonder how it should ever be omitted where Animism
prevails. For what can be more spontaneous than to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the aid of one’s father or friend, and why not ask the spirits
disembodied as freely as those in the flesh? In Melanesia
not every ghost is worshipped (as not having <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mana</i>); but a
man in danger may call upon his father, grandfather or
uncle: his nearness of kin being sufficient ground for it.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
Certainly: and that this is not always done where ghosts
are rife can only be because it is believed that the less one has
to do with them the better! Probably, this consideration
restrains for ages the early impulses to pray. Primitive man
anticipates the advice of Confucius: “Pay all respect to
spiritual beings, but keep them at a distance.”<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, certain forms of Magic come, after a time, to be
discountenanced or punished: black Magic, because it is
anti-social and criminal; other forms of Magic, when carried
on by private practitioners, because they infringe the monopoly
of supernatural power that has now been claimed by
dynasties and priesthoods; or (in other words) because the
public gods are jealous of all competitors. Legitimate Magic
has now been incorporated with Religion. And the power of
Religion becomes greater than that of Magic without Religion,
not only by the support of the influential classes, but also
because Religion, whether as worship of the public gods or
as sorcery or devil-worship, afflicts the human mind with
peculiar terrors; and, again, because Religion, should it
clarify morally and æsthetically, appeals more and more to
the affections—to the family affections and to loyalty. The
impersonality of pure Magic sets it (as it does Science) at a
great disadvantage in this competition.</p>

<p>Finally, whilst the failures of Magic always need to be
excused,—as by a mistake in the rites or by the opposition of
stronger Magic,—Religion brings with it a new excuse for
failure, namely, the caprice of the spirits or gods propitiated.
At their pleasure they may reject the prayers and sacrifices.
Persistence in such conduct on their part is sometimes met
by banishment, deprivation of rank, or other punishment—the
civilised methods of China; at other times by praying
louder and sacrificing more extravagantly, in the style that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
culminated in Mexico together with the power of barbaric
priesthood. Still the gods may be obdurate; and, probably,
to excuse the failure of propitiation by the caprice of the gods
was, from the first, looked upon as an eligible device:<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> not
observing that the caprice of the gods was incompatible with
the security of their worshippers; and, therefore, in conflict
with that desire of security which is the root of the whole
supernatural structure, whether magical or religious. This
conflict must have consequences.</p>

<p>Religion, then, very probably, is of later growth than Magic;
but whether Animism, as a belief in separable (or separate)
spirits, human or other, is later or not than Magic, there is
insufficient evidence. At any rate, their origins are independent.
Perhaps my own preference for the priority of
Magic depends, partly at least, on the convenience of that
view in arranging the following considerations.</p>


<h3><a id="ch06_03"></a>§ 3. Ideas and Practices of Magic adopted by Animism</h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Fundamental in Magic, wherever practised, is the idea
of force, invisible and intangible, which can operate at a
distance without any visible or tangible vehicle. The idea
may have been formed (as we have seen) by analogy with
several natural phenomena, such as the wind, radiant heat,
sound, odour, and it is involved in a savage’s beliefs concerning
the efficacy of charms, rites and spells. When a man dies,
he lies speechless and motionless, no longer exerts his accustomed
force in any way; but, if seen in a dream, he still
speaks and acts, perhaps wrestles with the dreamer. Here,
then, is that force which had deserted the body: it is visible
and tangible in dreams only, or perhaps sometimes by twilight;
or to gifted seers, or to dogs or pigs. The force exerted by
the ghost or spirit is the same thing as force magical, except
in one character: its action is capricious, depending on the
good or ill will of the ghost or spirit; whereas purely magical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
forces have uniform tendencies. Magic, then, prepares and
partially develops this idea of mysterious force, without
which the appearance of a dead man in a dream, after his
body has been buried or burnt, would have no reality or
practical consequences for the living. Comparison with
shadows and reflections could not lend reality to dreams;
for they require the presence of the body, and themselves have
no mechanical significance. Their association with the spirit
or ghost probably follows the use of their names to describe
the dream-imagery, which cannot at first have a name of its
own. The same names being used for shadow or reflection
and for spirit or dream-soul, the things are in some measure
identified; and then the idea of force may be associated with
shadows and reflections; so that the falling of a shadow upon
a man may injure or slay him.</p>

<p>Magic-force and spirit-force being the same thing, the
question whether <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">mana</i> is a magical or animistic notion is
misleading. It will be conceived of by different tribes in one
way or the other, according to the relative prevalence in one
or the other tribe of the animistic or of the magical mode of
explanation.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It is reasonable to expect that, as the ghost-theory
spread, the magical force of things should sometimes be conceived
of as spiritual; so that amulets and talismans would
come to be regarded as owing their virtue either to a controlling
spirit, or to an indwelling spirit peculiar to each: in
the latter case the charm is a fetich. When a charm is thus
considered, its efficacy is no longer expected to be uniform,
but depends on the mood of the indwelling or controlling
spirit. The fact that its efficacy, though formerly presumed
to be uniform, never was so, favours the new interpretation;
and this having been accepted, a cult (or a discipline) of the
spirit is apt to follow. Thus the magician becomes a sorcerer
or a priest.</p>

<p>In North Central Australia, short sticks or bones are used
for pointing at an enemy and directing magical force against
him. Only the Guangi and other tribes of the Gulf coast
manufacture dead men’s bones (femur or fibula) into pointers;
but these are traded southward, and are considered more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
potent than other pointers.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> A stick, then, is the primitive
talisman, often “sung” with a spell in Alcheringa words,
which the operator himself does not understand; and it
acts by pure magic. The dead man’s bone is more potent,
at first perhaps only because it is more oppressively gruesome
and terrifying; we are not told that it carries the power of
its former owner’s ghost; but how near the thought must be!
In South-East Australia, pointing with the bone (human
fibula) is very common; in pointing you name your victim
and say how he is to die; but that the efficacy of the rite
does not depend upon a spirit is shown by this, that, when
pointing, you tie a cord of human hair (attached to the bone)
tightly around your upper arm, in order to drive blood into
the bone. In other rites, however, in which the fat of a dead
man is used, the ghost of the dead is believed to assist the
operation; for a man’s fat, especially kidney-fat, is the seat
of his prowess and other virtues.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> An easy extension of ideas
by analogy would interpret a rite in which a dead man’s bone
is used, and which is on that account more potent, as owing
its superior potency to the assistance of the dead man’s ghost.
It seems easy; but resistance to the progress of explanation
is not peculiar to the civilised mind.</p>

<p>Again, in South-East Australia, a <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">bulk</i>—a pebble, usually
black and roundish—is carried by wizards as a powerful
talisman. A native dreamt of seeing two ghosts by his camp
fire, and, on waking, found a <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">bulk</i> where they had stood.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
How could such an impressive experience fail to raise a belief
in a connexion between ghosts and <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">bulks</i>: both so attractive
to the imagination, and alike mysterious and powerful?
Many such situations must strongly indicate an extension of
the ghost-theory, once it has been formed, to explain the influence
of charms and rites. A time comes with some tribes
when the activity and ubiquity of spirits is so much a matter
of course that every mysterious power is apt to be ascribed
to their presence. If a person or thing was originally taboo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
either by inherent virtue or by force of a spell or curse—a
talisman dangerous to every one who violated its sanctity—Animism
explains the danger by the wrath of a protecting
spirit. A boundary having long been taboo, a spirit is
imagined to protect the boundary, and becomes the god
Terminus. Diseases, at first attributed to Magic, are later
explained by Animism; so that whilst an Australian wizard
is content to suck a magically implanted stone or splinter from
his patient’s body, a priest of the Dyaks, having sucked out a
similar object, calls it a spirit.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The wonder is that at this
stage of thought any purely magical power can survive.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) An Omen is regarded as giving warning of some event,
although between event and omen there is no traceable connexion—in
this resembling many magical operations; and
at first omens may have been always so conceived of, and only
by degrees distinguished from charms and spells. But in
most parts of the world omens have come to be treated as
divine or spiritual premonitions; and the marks which
distinguish omens from the rest of Magic are such as to favour
a growth of the belief that they are sent by spirits. This
subject, however, is so extensive that a separate chapter
must be given to it.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Inasmuch as spells addressed to any object tend to the
personification of it, the personified object may, as the ghost-theory
gains strength, acquire an indwelling or controlling
spirit, and the spell addressed to it may become a prayer.
Not that this is the only way in which prayer may originate;
for (as remarked above) nothing can be simpler or less in
need of explanation than the invoking of the spirit of one’s
relatives (the ghost-theory having been established) to help
one or, at least, not to persecute. Indeed, it is not unreasonable
to suppose that this was often attempted, and not persisted
in for want of obtaining an answer; so that a long
tentative age preceded the settled custom of prayer. Nor is
it easy to see how belief in the efficacy of prayer (beginning in
this way) could ever have been established, unless it were
confirmed by coincidence—just like Magic. However, the
earliest form of prayer and of spell (whichever may have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the earlier) being the same—a simple expression of desire—whence
prayer and spell have been differentiated, it may
be impossible to decide whether a given ejaculation belongs
to one class or to the other. Thus Mr. R.&nbsp;W. Williamson tells
us that, amongst the Mafulu of New Guinea, when fishing in
the river Aduala, the fishers, after forming a weir, but before
fixing their net, all join in a sort of prayer or invocation to
the river: “Aduala, give us plenty of fish that we may eat
well.”<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> But he expressly says that, whilst they believe
certain parts of the river, such as a waterfall or deep pool, to
be haunted by spirits, they do not believe this of the river
itself,<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> and that generally their Animism is very backward.
The ejaculation, therefore, seems to be a spell. Compare
with it the Jakun spell to bring monkeys within shooting
distance:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">“Come ye down with souls enchanted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monkeys, by my spells enchanted.”<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">If, then, the original form of prayer and of spell is often the
same, the sole difference between them lies in the intention of
the speaker. One of the Kurnai, to stop the gales, cried:
“Let the West Wind be bound,”<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and this is evidently a
command and a spell; but if he regarded the wind as controlled
by a spirit, a change of tone would make it a prayer.
Still, whether with the spread of Animism a spell shall become
a prayer, must depend upon whether the spirit addressed is
believed to be the more easily importuned or coerced.</p>

<p>The taboo that often attaches to the names of the dead and
of other spirits may easily have been derived from the magical
practice of summoning by name, or of naming the victim of
a rite. To call a living man by name draws his attention and
often brings him to the spot; a magical naming is (from the
temper of Magic) uniformly effective; so that to avoid such
control names are kept secret; and when ghosts are believed
in, naming has the same power over them and is, therefore,
extremely dangerous. Hence, in Sorcery (a dangerous art),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to introduce the names of spirits into spells is to secure their
presence and assistance: and, in prayer, to use the true name
of the spirit or god addressed may be indispensable; the
worshipper’s intention is not enough.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) With the spread of Animism, magical rites often become
religious. This may occur by simply adding the invocation
of a spirit to a magical rite (as a spell may be added) in order
to strengthen it—the two actions remaining quite distinct;
or some degree of fusion may take place, obscuring more or less
the original character of the practice. The Kai (Papuans of
northern New Guinea) “make rain” by muttering a spell over
a stone, and at the same time calling upon Balong and Batu
to drive away Yondimi, a woman who holds up the rain; and
when rain enough has fallen, they strew hot ashes on the stone,
or put it in the fire, to stop the rain.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The animistic invocation,
being omitted from the process of stopping the rain, seems to
be merely adscititious to the making of it. Again, “When
rain is badly wanted in the Oraon country, the Oraons of
each village fix a day for the rain-making ceremony. On
the morning of the appointed day, the women of the village,
with the wife of the village priest or Pahan at their head,
proceed to the village spring or tank, and there, after ablution,
each woman fills her pitcher with water, and all proceed in a
body to a sacred pipar-tree.... On their arrival at the
sacred tree, all the women simultaneously pour the water in
their pitchers over the root of the tree, saying ‘May rain
fall on the earth like this.’ The wife of the village priest
now puts marks of vermilion, diluted in oil, on the trunk of
the tree. After this the women depart, and the Pahan or
village priest proceeds to sacrifice a red cock to the god
Baranda at the spot.... In this case, apparently, by direct
alliance, sacrifice and the anointing of the tree with vermilion
have been superimposed upon what was once, perhaps,
purely a ceremony of imitative magic.”<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Mr. Warde Fowler
tells us that an ancient Iguvian document contains instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
for the lustration of the people before a campaign: the
male population assembled in its military divisions; around
the host a procession went three times; at the end of each
circuit there was prayer to Mars and to two female associates
of his power, to bless the people of Iguvium and to curse
their enemies: and he observes that religion has here been
imposed upon the original magic-ceremony. For the idea
must have been that, by drawing a magic circle around the
host, it would be protected in the enemy’s country against
hostile magic by being rendered holy. “A later and animistic
age would think of them (the soldiers) as needing protection
against hostile spirits, of whose ways and freaks they were, of
course, entirely ignorant.” Hence the prayer to Mars.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Similarly, rites connected with seed-time and harvest,
originally magical, become religious, as beliefs grow up in
spirits of the rice, or corn, or vine, or in gods of agriculture
or fertility. Thus, as magical power is the same thing as
spiritual power, magical practices may be not merely the
antecedents but even the foundations of religious practices.
Long after the development of Animism, magical practices
are maintained by natural conservatism; if priests exist,
they try, of course, to annex such practices to the worship
of their god; and if the annexation is accomplished, whether
by priestly management or by a popular movement, no incongruity
may be felt for a long time between the uniformity
of Magic and the caprice of Animism; the whole celebration
is called Religion, and becomes suffused with religious feeling.</p>


<h3><a id="ch06_04"></a>§ 4. Retrogradation</h3>

<p>On the other hand, in all these cases, the animistic interpretation
of the power of fetiches, omens, prayers, rites, whether
original (as Prof. Wundt holds) or acquired, may be lost, and
a magical interpretation alone remain. For one’s mind
becomes so engrossed with objects or practices (such as
fetich-things or prayers) that are regarded as necessary to
the gratification of any masterful desire, that not only
irrelevant ideas, but any ideas not indispensable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
connexion between the objects or practices and the gratifications,
may be forgotten; and as objects or practices acquire
interest in themselves, even the gratifications formerly
desired may be forgotten. Just as such means as money or
books, business or study, may become ends to the exclusion
of further enjoyments, so images or rites, at first subsidiary
to the obtaining of demonic aid in love or revenge, may be
cared for with a fervour that excludes the thought of any
intervening means to those ends (especially such means as a
capricious spirit who may fail one), and may even be employed
under a vague fear or discomfort in the omission of them,
when no particular purpose is any longer remembered. On
the principle of least effort, we attend only to what is necessary.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A saint’s finger-joint may at first be treasured as a
fetich having the power of the saint to save from shipwreck;
after a time it may be carried as an amulet without any
thought of the saint’s interposition; whilst the evil to be
averted is more and more vaguely imagined. Seeing that
spiritual and magical agencies are the same invisible, unintelligible
force, how easy to interchange them!</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Similarly omens, from being divine messages, each
relating to a particular undertaking, may come to be merely
occurrences that encourage or discourage a man, or a tribe,
at any time; because, by tradition, they are lucky or unlucky.
Or practically the same result may be reached by philosophy:
as with those Stoics who explained that omens are prophetic
not as sent by the gods, but as involved in the same procession
of fatal events. Fate, before any laws of nature had been
discovered, was nothing but all-comprehensive Magic: which
left out or mediatised the gods, because, in a philosophical
consideration of the world, they are worse than useless.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) As to prayers, in any rational conception of them, the
form of words conveying them cannot matter to a god, as
long as they are piously meant and devoutly meditated.
Yet everywhere there has been a tendency to reduce them
to strict formulæ, any departure from which may, it is feared,
impair their efficacy. So far as this occurs, their operation
is magical; they have become spells. Such is the result of
custom, with mental inertia too dull to think; of an irreligious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
temperament, getting quickly through an uncongenial task;
of a superstitious unimaginative spirit, afraid to omit any
traditionary means of safety and for whom a praying-wheel
is the way of peace. To rob prayer of its religious meaning,
there is the ever-present example of the magical spells that
operate by their own force. A form of words, whether magical
or supplicatory, that has been among the antecedents of a
time of peace or of gain, seems to be amongst its causes, and
is repeated that such a time may continue. Of the countless
cases in which prayers have degenerated into spells, none is
more instructive than the one recorded by Dr. Rivers in his
account of the dairy-ritual of the Todas. The prayers offered
during this ritual are uttered in the throat, so that the words
are undistinguishable; and they are divided into two parts:
first, a list of sacred beings and objects mentioned by sacred
names, much of it unintelligible; and, secondly, a petition
for the protection and welfare of the buffaloes: the former
is now the more important; the latter is apt to be slurred
over, or perhaps omitted.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Of the Roman public prayers,
Mr. Warde Fowler says: “The idea that the spoken formula
(derived from an age of Magic) was efficient only if no slip
were made, seems to have gained in strength instead of
diminishing, as we might have expected it to do with advancing
civilisation.”<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> To justify the belief in formulæ it may
be asserted that the gods themselves prescribed them: an
excuse for the superstitious dread of altering what is traditionary,
and for the persuasion that the form itself has
mysterious virtue.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) That other religious ceremonies, repeated from age to
age, have the same tendency as prayers to become dead
forms from which the spirit of communion or devotion has
departed—though under favourable conditions it may return
from time to time—is too well known; and if in their emptiness
they are still believed somehow to serve their purpose,
it can only be as magical rites. One may be surprised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
find at what an early stage of culture this tendency is fully
realised. William Ellis, the celebrated missionary, says of
the people of Raiatea: “The efficacy of their [religious]
services consisted in the rigid exactness with which sacred
days were kept, and religious ceremonies performed, without
the least regard to the motives and dispositions of the devotees....
In their idol-worship, however costly the sacrifice, and
however near its close the ceremony might be, if the priest
omitted or misplaced any word in the prayers, or if his
attention was diverted by any means so that the prayer
was broken, the whole was rendered unavailing: he must
prepare other victims and repeat his prayers over from the
commencement.”<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> How this concern for details must be a
relapse into magical notions may be read in the account
of rites to stop the rainfall in Torres Straits; where (we are
told) if the wizard omit any detail, the rain continues.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
Perhaps the notion of the perfect definiteness of causation
(though not consistently adhered to in other matters) arose
from this meticulous anxiety of superstition: it also, however,
furnishes excuses for failure both to priests and wizards.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) In Magic there must be something deeply satisfying
to the average mind: it precedes Religion, supplies the
basis and framework of religious practices, and remains when
Religion is in ruins; and when people change their Religion,
they retain their Magic. Among the Fijians,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> those who
were Christianised lost their dread of witchcraft last of all
the relics of their heathenism. Among the Cherokees,
“Gahuni, like several others of their Shamans, combined the
professions of Indian conjuror and Methodist preacher.”<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
In Norway, after the general acceptance of Christianity,
Lapland witchcraft was still valued. The victory of the
insurgents at Stiklestad, where St. Olaf fell, was thought to
have been due to the magic armour of reindeer-skin that
Thore Hund had brought from Lapland; though all St. Olaf’s
men wore the cross upon helmet and shield.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Since then the spiritualising of Magic and the despiritualising
of Religion are both real processes of evolution, it may
be difficult, or even impossible, to say of any given magical
practice, without particular knowledge of its history, whether
it is primitive or residuary. Sir E.&nbsp;B. Tylor writes: “Charm
formulas are in very many cases actual prayers, and as such
are intelligible. Where they are merely verbal forms, producing
their effect on nature and man by some unexplained
process, may not they, or the types they were modelled on,
have been originally prayers, since dwindled into mystic
sentences?”<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> The circumstances of each case must guide
our judgment. What shall we say, for example, of the
addresses to spirits in Melanesia, where it is difficult to find
in any dialect a word for prayer, “so closely does the notion
of efficacy cling to the form of words employed”?<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Are
spells there rising into prayers, or prayers sinking back into
spells?</p>


<h3><a id="ch06_05"></a>§ 5. Spirits know Magic, teach it, and inspire Magicians</h3>

<p>Ghosts know Magic, because they knew it in the flesh;
and, by analogy, similar knowledge is likely to be attributed
to spirits that are reputed never to have been in the flesh.
As fear exalts all the powers of a ghost above his former
reach, it may be expected to raise his magical powers, especially
if he had already been famous in that way. And,
generally, it does so; but, exceptionally, we read that, among
the Lengua Indians (west of the Paraguay), whilst any man
may attempt Magic, professional “witch-doctors” are
numerous and powerful; yet they are not credited with
extraordinary powers after death.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Elsewhere, however,
the dead magician does not forget his art. Where Shamanism
prevails and the power of Magic or Sorcery attains its greatest
social importance, the spirit of a dead shaman makes some
advance toward deification. Among the Buryats, dead shamans
are worshipped with prayer and sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to the <cite>Kalevala</cite>, the famous collection of Finnish poetry,
in Tuonela (Hades), whither all dead shamans descend,
their wisdom and magical power accumulate, exceeding that
of any living adept; so that even Väinämöinen, the wizard
hero, goes down to learn there the magical words he does
not know.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Spirits, knowing Magic, also teach it, and make magicians
and prophets. In South-East Australia, the profession of
wizard may be hereditary in the eldest son; or obtained
through initiation by another wizard—(a corpse is dug up,
its bones pounded for the neophyte to chew; he is plastered
with excrement, etc., till he becomes frenzied, his eyes
bloodshot, his behaviour maniacal);<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> or a man may become
a wizard by meeting a spirit who opens his side and inserts
quartz-crystals, etc.; or by deriving power from Daramulun;
or by sleeping at a grave, where the deceased opens him,
and takes out and replaces his bowels. Here we have a
list of the most usual ways in which magical powers can
anywhere be acquired—by inheritance, by tuition, by the
aid of ghosts or spirits; and it suggests the hypothesis that
at first the magic art was inherited, or learnt from a former
wizard; and that, with the growth of Animism, it became
in some cases preferable, because more impressive (and
cheaper), to acquire it from a ghost or spirit. For this is
more probable than that, at the early stage in which Animism
exists in South-East Australia, retrogradation should have
taken place; so that the making of wizards, formerly ascribed
only to spirits, should in some cases have been remitted to
inheritance or to professional tuition. That in spite of the
greater prestige that may attach to a diploma obtained from
spirits, the right of practising by inheritance or by tuition
often still persists, though, no doubt, due in part to dull
conservatism, may also be understood by considering family
and professional motives. There are heavy fees for teaching
witchcraft, besides the profits made in some tribes by selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the control of familiar spirits; the profession is lucrative,
and a wizardy family has an interest in its monopoly; which
must be impaired, if any man who loses himself in the bush
may come back with some cock-and-bull story about a ghost
and his new metaphysical insides, and straightway set himself
up with the equivalents of a brass plate and red lantern.
Among the Boloki on the Congo, the careers of blacksmith
and witch-doctor are open only to the relatives of living
adepts. At least, practically (but for a few exceptionally
cunning and rascally interlopers who creep and intrude and
climb into the fold), the office of witch-doctor is hereditary:
a father trains his son, and will train (for a large fee) any
youth whose family has already produced a witch-doctor.
But a candidate without family connexion is told that he
must first kill by witchcraft all the members of his family,
as offerings to the fetich of that branch of the profession to
which he aspires.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Not only the spirits of primitive Animism, but likewise
the gods of maturer Religions, know and teach Magic. In
the Maori mythology, Tumatauenga, one of the first generation
of gods, determined incantations for making all sorts
of food abundant and for controlling the winds, as well as
prayers to Heaven suited to all the circumstances of human
life; and the god Rongotakawin, having shaped the hero
Whakatau out of the apron of Apakura, taught him Magic
and enchantments of every kind.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Prof. Rhys tells us that
the Welsh god Mâth ab Mathonwy, or Math Hên (the ancient),
was the first of the three great magicians of Welsh Mythology;
and he taught Magic to the culture hero, Gwydion ab Dôn,
with whose help he created a woman out of flowers.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The
Teutonic equivalent of Gwydion is Woden, or Othin; and he
too was a magician, “the father of spells,” who acquired
his wisdom by gazing down into the abyss, whilst he hung
nine nights on the tree, an offering to himself (and in other
ways); and, in turn, he teaches Siegfried the omens.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
also taught the northern people shape-changing, and by spells
controlled fire and the winds.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> In Egypt Magic was taught
by Thoth, in Babylonia by Merodach, and in Japan by
Ohonomachi the earth-god. Indeed, whence, unless from
divine beings, could this precious wisdom be obtainable?</p>

<p>Spirits also inspire or possess the magician, so that through
him, as their mouthpiece or instrument, prophecies are
uttered or wonders wrought. We have seen that in South-East
Australia the rites of initiation to wizardry by a wizard,
without the aid of spirits, cause a candidate to become
frenzied or maniacal. With the growing fashion of animistic
interpretation, such behaviour is (along with insanity) put
down to possession by a spirit. The common beliefs that a
man’s soul can slip in and out of him and that a man may
reincarnate the spirit of an ancestor, facilitate this idea of
possession. Dreams concerning spirits also promote the
belief that a miracle-monger owes to them his supernatural
powers. The Tunguses of Turnkhausk say that the man
destined to be a shaman sees in a dream the devil performing
rites, and so learns the secrets of his craft. Among the
Trans-Baikal Tunguses, he who wishes to become a shaman
declares that such or such a dead shaman appeared to him
in a dream, and ordered him to be his successor; and he
shows himself crazy, stupefied and timorous. The Yakut
shaman is preordained to serve the spirits, whether he wishes
it or not: he begins by raging like a madman, gabbles, falls
unconscious, runs about the woods, into fire and water,
injures himself with weapons. Then an old shaman trains
him.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> On the Congo, a man may become a wizard by claiming
to be the medium of a dead man; and a medium falls
into a frenzy, shouts, trembles all over, his body undulates,
sweat breaks out, foam gathers on his mouth, his eyeballs
roll: he speaks an archaic language if he knows one.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> In
Santa Cruz (Melanesia), prophecy is practised by men whose
bodies are taken possession of, and their voices used, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
ghosts: they foam at the mouth, writhe, are convulsed as
if in madness; and the mad, too, are believed to be possessed.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
Similarly the Pythoness: the behaviour of the possessed is
everywhere the same. But as the same behaviour marks
the youth training for a wizard before the theory of possession
or inspiration has been adopted, it is plain that the
animistic theory does not create the phenomena, but is merely,
at a certain stage of thought, the inevitable explanation of
them.</p>

<p>Facility of falling into frenzy may be the test of fitness for
wizardry; the Bokongo professor who trains a pupil, beats
his drum, shakes his rattle, and tries to drive the fetich-power
into him; if the pupil remains stolid, he is disqualified;
but if he sways to the music of the drum, jumps about like a
madman, etc., he passes.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> These antics at first astonish
the beholder, strengthen the faith of patients in the witch-doctor,
and of the witch-doctor in himself, and often have
a sort of hypnotic fascination for both him and them; and
they gain in value under Animism by being also proofs of
supernatural assistance or control: and being an essential
mark of the adept at certain stages of the art’s development,
they are sometimes induced by rhythmic drumming, singing
and dancing, sometimes by fastings or drugs.</p>

<p>“Black Magic” is, at first, merely the use of Magic for
anti-social purposes; very early a distinction is recognised
between wizards who cause disease and those who cure it.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
“Black” and “white” wizards are sometimes at open
strife.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> When tribal gods come to be recognised, “black”
wizards are those who are assisted or inspired by inferior
gods or demons, who may be opponents and rivals of the high
gods. Hence the same god who, whilst paramount, aids or
inspires in an honourable way, may, if deposed or superseded,
become the abettor of Black Magic—as happened to
our own gods, and to others, before and after the coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of Christianity; for the ancient divine sources of power and
prophecy became devils and witch-masters. The magicians
of our Middle Ages, of whom Faustus is the type, were “black”
and, in the spirit of Shamanism, pretended to rule the devils;
but, overshadowed by Christianity, they—at least in popular
belief—bought their power at a price.</p>


<h3><a id="ch06_06"></a>§ 6. Spirits operate by Magic</h3>

<p>Spirits may operate through men whom they possess, or
by their naked soul-force, or by words (that is, by spells),
or by merely thinking:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When a man is possessed by a spirit, it is the soul-force
of that spirit which has entered him and taken command
of his voice or limbs; and we have seen that this soul-force
is the same as force magical. The spirit’s action is the same
as that of the <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">bugin</i> or wizard, who boasted of having entered
a horse and galloped off.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) By Animism, prior to philosophical reflection, the spirit
is not conceived of as strictly incorporeal; its force, which
is magical, is quasi-mechanical. Hence, in South-East
Australia, spirits can carry off a man in a bag<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> (made, no
doubt, of bag-soul-stuff). But spirits may act upon a man
very effectually without being mechanically felt; as among
the Ekoi, where ghosts are either good or bad, and generally
a good goes with a bad one to counteract his malevolence;
but should a bad one wander forth alone, and should a man
without the gift of seeing ghosts (which depends upon his
having four eyes) run against it in the street, the ghost will
not step aside, but strikes the man in the face; who then
has lock-jaw, and dies.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> As we have reason to believe that
this is not the natural ætiology of lock-jaw, the ghost’s action
is plainly magical: like that of the corpse-candle which, not
long ago, on a slope of Plinlimmon one rainy night, a man
inadvertently ran against, and was “struck down dead as
a horse.”<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The mere apparition of a ghost (at least, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
any one who has not four eyes) is magical. The sending of
a bird as an omen is magical.</p>

<p>This immediate power of the gods is nowhere shown more
emphatically than in their metamorphoses: that these are
sometimes wrought by spells or other enchantments proves
that the operation is magical. Australian wizards transform
themselves into kangaroos and other animals; and, in Arunta
mythology, in the earliest Alcheringa (period of mythical
ancestors), the Ungambikula—so called from having arisen
out of nothing—with stone knives cut men out of rudimentary
masses of unorganised matter (inapertua), and then transformed
themselves into little lizards.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> So this sort of self-conjuring
may be said to begin at the beginning; and it
cannot be necessary to accumulate examples of metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Several explanations of this belief in the possibility of
changing the form of one’s body, or of having it changed
by others, have been offered: none perhaps entirely satisfactory.
We are not here concerned with the passing of a
soul from one body to another—from a man into a wolf or
into a serpent, or conversely: given the conception of a
separable soul, that is easy to understand. What has to be
explained is the belief in a magical change of the body itself,
as in the common European superstition that a man may
turn into a wolf, and back again, like Sigmund and his son
in the <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Volsung Saga</cite>. It has been pointed out (i) that the
savage may observe striking changes in nature: as in the
shape of clouds and smoke, the burning of wood into flame,
smoke and ashes, the evaporation of water; the turning of
eggs into caterpillars, reptiles, birds, or of a chrysalis into an
imago; the appearance of worms in putrefying bodies, and
so forth.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> With such facts before him, why should not the
savage imagine himself also capable of transformation?
(ii) Dream-images, too, pass one into another in a marvellous
way. (iii) Since men are often called by the names of animals,
how easy to suppose that, at times, they may really be those
animals. How easy to confound a man with his Totem.
In many savage dances, animals are imitated, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
imagination-belief in the reality of the pantomime grows
very strong. (iv) The savage, when his imagination has been
excited, is not clever at penetrating conjuring tricks and
disguises; and some men, at first for their own ends, may
have disguised themselves as animals and passed as animals;
and in support of this explanation it may be observed that
the animal into which men transform themselves is oftenest
the most feared in their neighbourhood—the wolf, leopard,
or tiger; and, of course, one case believed in, others follow
by analogy. The mere report of such an happening might
generate belief by force of fear. (v) In a wild country, a
man (say one who is pursued) often disappears and is indiscoverable;
so that he may seem to have turned into a
kangaroo, or a stone, or a tree that appears in his place,
as Daphne hid successfully in a laurel-thicket: or if such
an occurrence did not originate the belief in metamorphosis,
it may have helped to confirm it. (vi) In mental disease,
the patient sometimes believes himself to be some kind of
animal, and acts accordingly: perhaps as a result of the
popular belief, but doubtless also confirming it.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Weighing
all these hypotheses, I lean to the view that, starting from
the fact (as ground of analogy) that astonishing changes are
observed in nature and in dreams, the belief in metamorphosis
as a magical operation rests chiefly upon the deceptions and
confident assertions of wizards that they can, and do, change
their form, supported by their reputation for wonder-working
and by the fears of their neighbours. Now, if wizards can
change their shapes, of course the gods can.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Spirits and gods are known to use amulets and talismans,
not invented by poets as symbols, but prized as the
instruments of their power, as an enchanter values his wand.
Such are the caduceus of Hermes, the cestus of Aphrodite,
Thor’s hammer Mjölnir, Woden’s spear Gunguir and his
wishing staff. The gods of Egypt and Babylon also wore
charms. Since chieftains are frequently magicians, and also
become gods, it follows that the gods are magicians; though,
indeed, as Grimm observes, their power is to be called
miraculous rather than magical. But Magic, being the
highest power known to men, and the most desired, is of
course attributed to spirits and to gods.</p>

<p>The most extensive powers of spirits, however, depend on
the use of words or spells. The hero of the Western Isles of
Torres Straits, Kwoiam, employed magical formulæ.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The
gods and demigods of the Maories carried out their extraordinary
adventures by the power of incantations. Maui,
by incantations, fishes up dry land from the bottom of the
sea, and turns his brother-in-law into a dog; Tawhaki and
his brother Karahi, by incantations, make themselves invisible,
and avenge their father Hema upon his enemies; and so
forth.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Celtic and Teutonic deities worked wonders by songs
and spells. Isis was the greatest enchantress that ever lived.
She made from the spittle of Ra a serpent that bit and poisoned
him; and then she healed him by an incantation, having first
compelled him to reveal to her his name, to the knowledge
of which the god himself owed his power over gods and men;
so that she obtained the mastery over all the gods.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>As spells, when used by men, may be more efficacious
when muttered and whispered than when spoken aloud, so
they may retain their power when silently wished or thought;
and it is the same with spirits: to control events it may be
enough for them to think. And this belief emerges at no
very high level of Animism; it needs no philosophical instruction
in the mysterious energy of ideas. The Sia Indians
(North Mexico) have a Cougar Society, which meets for a
two days’ ceremonial, before a hunting expedition, to propitiate
the cougar (puma), because he is the great father and
master of all game. He is believed to draw all kinds of
game to him by sitting still with folded arms and mentally
demanding their presence; and by the same means he sends
game to whomsoever he favours.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Apparently, then, Magic is an art antecedent to the existence
of spirits and ready for their use; and they stand in
the same relations to it as men do. Animistic usages are
originally magical—spells, rites, metamorphoses; and all
animistic ideas are magical, except one—the capriciousness
of spiritual agency.</p>


<h3><a id="ch06_07"></a>§ 7. Spirits are controlled by Magic</h3>

<p>The savage imagination having created out of dreams and
other strange experiences a world of invisible and powerful
beings who may be friendly or hostile,—so human that they
must be accessible to prayers, but often turn a deaf ear to
them—must desire sacrifices, yet often reject them—capricious
and inscrutable—it became necessary, in order to restore
confidence in all the relations of life, that their caprice should
somehow be overcome; and to accomplish this three ways
were open: first, to increase the prayers and sacrifices until
their importunity and costliness should prove irresistible—and
this way led to all the magnificence and to all the horrors
of religious rites; secondly, to work upon the fears or vulnerability
of spirits by beating, starving, slaying, banishing or
degrading them; or, thirdly, to constrain them, as men are
often constrained, by magical rites and formulæ. From the
beginning this necessity is felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The constraint of spirits by fear or violence is characteristic
of Fetichism. The wizards of the Congo catch spirits in traps;
or drive them into animals, which they behead; or spear
them in some dark corner, and then exhibit their blood upon
the spear-head. Passing from the Congo through many ages
of progress, we arrive in China, and find that in time of
drought, if the city-god neglects to put an end to it, he is
first of all entreated; but that failing, his idol is stripped
naked and put to stand in the sun; or an iron chain is hung
round his neck—the mark of a criminal—till rain falls; or he
may be dethroned altogether.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> With such crude practices,
however, we are not now concerned.</p>

<p>The control of spirits by Magic, especially by spells—or
by other spirits who, in turn, are controlled by spells—is
in its earlier form characteristic of Shamanism: indeed, it
is the essence of Shamanism; though, of course, in many
shamanistic tribes, having intercourse with peoples of different
culture, other beliefs, ascribing independent or even superior
power to spirits, are often found. Spirits may be so completely
subdued by spells as to excite little fear. Among
the Yurats and Ostyaks, the shamans treat their spirits
without ceremony, and even buy and sell them.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> So do
the Esquimo angekoqs. In Greenland, “all phenomena are
controlled by spirits, and these spirits are controlled by
formulæ or charms, which are mainly in possession of the
medicine-men, although certain simple charms may be owned
and used by any one.” Hence, “nothing like prayer or
worship is possible”;<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> for why supplicate spirits whom you
can command? “The rule of man—not of all men, but of
one specially gifted (the shaman), over Nature, or over the
superior beings who direct her, is the fundamental idea of
Shamanism.”<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The shaman’s power depends on knowledge
of the names, natures and origins of all things and spirits,
and of the words that control them; but also on his own
extraordinary personality, as manifested in orgiastic frenzy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Megalomania, the vain imagination of being a “superman,”
is generally characteristic of magicians. Nothing can be
more contrary than this attitude to what most of us understand
by Religion.</p>

<p>One condition of the prevalence of Shamanism among any
people, or group of peoples, seems to be the absence from
among them of chieftains who have attained to any high
degree of political power, and the consequent non-existence
of authoritative gods. Hence it spreads throughout the
tribes of Northern Europe and Asia, from Finland to Kamtchatka,
and with a less intensive sway amongst the Indians
of North and South America. Under such conditions the
shaman is subordinate to no one in this world; nor, therefore,
in the spirit-world. But where there are authoritative chiefs,
authoritative gods correlative with them are approached by
an order of men who are priests rather than magicians—that
is to say, are regarded as dealing less in magic than in prayer
and sacrifice. And this state of affairs is apt to give rise to
increasing pomp and extravagance of rites, to which there
is no visible limit; so that in some cases, as in Ashanti and
Mexico, worship became homicide, and a sort of national
insanity was established. For from such practices there
results no security in the satisfaction of desire; the caprice
of the gods cannot by such means be overcome; their appetite
grows by what it feeds on, and so does the fanaticism of the
priesthood.</p>

<p>Now, in political affairs something similar happens: the
caprice of despotic rulers becomes intolerable; and, in some
countries, submission to their tyranny has amounted to a
sort of national insanity. Elsewhere devices have been
adopted to limit the power of rulers. Avoiding assassination
or revolution, it has been found possible to impose upon
a king restraints derived from his own sanctity and divine
power. One such device has been to surround him with
innumerable taboos which, at length, prevent him from doing
anything. It is true that the ostensive reason for this was
not the limitation of his power, but the preservation of his
vitality, upon which hung the welfare of the whole world;
and probably this was, at first, the conscious purpose; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
one effect of it was to limit his power, and the utility of this
was its natural sanction. There are many cases in human
life in which a great advantage has been gained for the race
by means which were intended by the conscious agents to
have an entirely different result.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In several countries,
where the king has been bound by taboos, another man has
by some pretext usurped his power; so that this way of
restraining despotism is not a good one. But in Japan,
where it had been adopted by a political people, the Tycoon,
who succeeded to the power of the taboo-burdened Mikado,
himself fell at last under equivalent restrictions, whilst affairs
were directed by his ministers. Such is the natural tendency
of this device amongst positivists, like the Japanese; elsewhere
it may transfer the regal power to warriors or to priests.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
Another way of restraining the king is to establish the
principle that he rules by the laws, and that laws, though
made by himself, cannot be altered. And this may have
been the purpose of the unchangeableness of the laws of the
Medes and Persians; and according to the <cite>Book of Daniel</cite><a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
it was used in this way; though, certainly, the older authority
of Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> shows that, in some cases, the king’s advisers
could find a way out for their master. Our own forefathers
were no doubt the wisest people that ever lived; and their
plan was to acknowledge fully the divinity that doth hedge
a king, to declare that, in fact, he could do no wrong, and
then to visit all the iniquities of government upon his ministers.</p>

<p>If kings need restraint, much more do invisible gods: and
many nations have sought to limit their prerogative, either
by Magic or by legal fictions which, in relation to gods, can
have only a magical operation. Whilst the tone of the
<cite>Rigveda</cite> is truly religious (though even there “the idea is
often expressed that the might and valour of the gods is
produced by hymns, sacrifices and especially offerings of
soma”), “in the Yajurveda the sacrifice itself has become
the centre of thought and desire, its correct performance
in every detail being all-important. Its power is now so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that it not only influences but compels the gods to do the will
of the officiating priest.”<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> In Egyptian rites of sacrifice
and prayer, the kind of victim and the manner of slaying and
cutting it up were minutely and unchangeably decreed.
“The formulas accompanying each act of the sacrificial
priest contained a certain number of words, whose due
sequence and harmonies might not suffer the slightest modification
even by the god himself, under penalty of losing their
efficacy. They were always recited with the same rhythm,
according to a system of melody in which every tone had its
virtue, combined with movements that confirmed the sense
and worked with irresistible effect; one false note, a single
discord between the succession of gestures and the utterance
of the sacramental words, any hesitation, any awkwardness
in the accomplishment of a rite, and the sacrifice was vain.”<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
But if all was in order, the god was bound to grant the
petition. Babylonian religious ceremonies “had for the
most part the same end and object as the magical text used
with them; they were not so much a communion with the
deities of heaven, as an attempt to compel them by particular
words to relieve the worshipper from trouble, or to bestow
upon him some benefit.” Ceremonies, therefore, were useless
unless accurately performed in word and deed; “ritual was
a sort of acted magic.”<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> These accounts of the religious
ceremonies of the highest barbaric civilisations are almost in
the same words as William Ellis uses in his account of worship
at Raiatea about the beginning of the nineteenth century;
except that Ellis does not say that the Polynesian gods
were bound to grant the requests so presented. Accordingly,
I have treated the Raiatean example under Retrogradation,
and those of Egypt and Babylon as cases of half-conscious
policy. No doubt both retrogradation and policy were present
in all cases; but it seems reasonable to suppose that the
latter predominated where order was more settled (an analogue
of the order required in heaven) and thought was better
trained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>One may wonder why a magical ritual should be preferred
and trusted rather than genuinely devotional worship; since
it must, in fact, just as often result in disappointment. But,
first, as to the priesthood, an elaborate ritual, difficult to
carry out, is favourable to their power, because only professionals
can execute it; so that they must necessarily be
employed; and the more elaborate and exigent it is, the
more necessary they are. But, then, the more attention
the ritual demands, the less there is to spare for thinking
of the gods. Secondly, as to the people, since the failure
of worship in attaining our ends may be due either (animistically)
to the caprice of the gods or (magically) to an error
of the priest, it is not surprising that men should trust the
specialist whose education is well attested rather than the
god whose character is inscrutable. Thirdly, a magical ritual
appeals to the expectation of uniformity, the sole ground of
confidence concerning the future, and therefore what men
most desire. Nevertheless, the religious form of the rites
(though empty of religious feeling) is maintained; partly,
because the whole political and ecclesiastical fabric rests upon
the animistic tradition; partly, because Animism has such
hold upon men’s minds that a few remain devout; whilst
even those who regard the rites as magical do not perceive
that magic is the antithesis of religion and rigidly excludes
it. Only a few natural positivists and philosophers regard
public worship as merely a political institution.</p>

<p>The idea of a transaction by which the gods are legally
bound—so much help for so much worship—may be present
in all magical ritual; but in some religions the analogy of
human relations according to law is explicitly extended to
the relations of men with gods. The Jewish religion was
based on a covenant; and, according to some theologians,
so is the Christian. It has often been said that Roman
religion implied a belief in legal obligation imposed upon
the gods by rites duly performed; and Mr. Warde Fowler,
who thinks more highly than some have done of the genuineness
of religious feeling amongst the Romans, at least in private
worship, yet says that in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vota publica</i> we find something
like a bargain or covenant with the deity in the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
State.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Legal obligation implies effectual sanctions that
may be brought to bear upon transgressors, gods or men;
and at a low stage of Animism, when no spirit exceeds the
rank of demon, there may be no incongruity in bringing to
reason a recalcitrant spirit by stopping his rations or maltreating
his image; but when high gods have obtained the
homage of men, to punish <em>them</em> calls for great audacity or
very subtle management. The Chinese have managed the
matter to admiration. The Emperor of China acknowledged
himself subject to the spirits of Earth and Heaven; but he
himself was the son of Heaven, and all other spirits were
subject to him. He ruled alike over the dead and the
living. He made deities and appointed them their functions;
promoted them and distributed amongst them titles
of honour, if they did good works; or, if they failed in their
duties, degraded them. In the <cite>Pekin Gazette</cite> one finds “the
deities figuring, not occasionally but very frequently, in
every department of official business, and treated much as
if they were highly respectable functionaries of a superior
order, promoted to some kind of upper house, whose abilities
and influence were nevertheless still at the service of the
State.”<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Nowhere has the unity of Church and State been
so completely realised, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pax deorum</i> so conclusively
established. One may interpret the facts at discretion:
an animist may accept them literally and seriously; a
devotee of Magic may regard decrees in the <cite>Pekin Gazette</cite>
as spells that have coercive power in the spirit-world; a
Confucian mandarin will think that an excellent plan has
been devised for enlisting the superstitions of the simple-minded
in support of law and order. We may suppose that
for him Animism is but an episode in the history of human
thought.</p>

<p>Another way of excluding spiritual caprice, which we might
suppose to have been discovered by philosophers, but which
appears to be older than what we usually call “Philosophy,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
is to subordinate the gods to Fate. The idea has been
attributed to the astronomers or astrologers of Babylon that
Fate must be above the gods as the constant heaven of the
fixed stars is above the planets:<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> an analogy characteristic
of magical thought. But the roots of the idea of Fate are
much older and wider spread in the slow, steady growth of
the belief in uniformity, which is the common ground of
Magic and Science; and (as I have said) before laws of nature
had been discovered, Fate was an all-comprehensive Magic.
Fate reduces the gods to the status of wheels in a machine;
omens and oracles, instead of being sent or inspired by the
gods, are also part of the machinery, and may point to their
destruction; prayers and sacrifices are other parts of the
machinery and, at most, may be a means of assuaging the
anxiety of one’s own heart. A stern way of envisaging
the world: but it gives not only security against the gods,
but also resignation and tranquillity.</p>

<p>Philosophical Christianity regards the actions of God as
always manifested, in the physical order, through “second
causes,” or, in other words, in “the laws of nature”; and,
in the spiritual order, as always observing the moral laws
that are the principles of divine Reason; in either case
there can be no variableness nor shadow of turning.</p>

<p>Magic, like Science, believes in uniformities of nature, and
seeks by a knowledge of them to control events; but Magic
is so eager to control events that it cannot wait to learn the
true uniformities; it is not moved, like Science, by curiosity
as to the truth, but by blind desire for present results. The
cult of spirits seeks to control events not by knowledge
of their natural causes, but by appealing to hyperphysical
causes, and it resembles the belief in Free Will, by which
men hope, through the influx of some unknown energy, to
escape the bondage of their own vices: for Kant rightly
treated “Freedom” as a cosmological problem, the supposed
intervention of a cause that is transcendent and not in the
course of nature. The intervention of Free Will (whether
divine or human) is sought in order to avert injurious fortune,
to realise our personal or social schemes more quickly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
cheaply than our own efforts can, to avoid the consequences
of our own actions, amongst which is bondage to our own
vices: for all these, give us variability, miracle, caprice.
But to foresee and control events physical or social, including
the conduct of others, to be confident in the effects of our
own actions according to our purposes, and in the stability
of our own character: for all these, there must be uniformity.
In the long run the latter considerations determine our
thoughts; and the necessity of uniformity to a rational life
may be one cause of our belief (so far out-running the evidence)
in uniformities of causation and of space-relations and of all
that we mean by natural law.</p>

<br />OMENS</h2>


<h3><a id="ch07_01"></a>§ 1. The Prevalence of Omens</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">When</span> great disasters are about to befall a state or nation
it often happens that there is some warning,” says Herodotus.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
It happens, indeed, not only to states and nations,
but to eminent men, or even to common men, children and
old women. An old woman who in England sees the new
moon for the first time through glass, will not be surprised
when, next morning, the market-basket drops from her arm in
the middle of the street. In Fiji, if a woman putting bananas
into a pot let one fall on the outside, or if the bread-fruit
burst in roasting, she wrung her hands in dismay and cried
aloud.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The whole world is full of such portents, and has
been many thousands of years; and there is no clearer
disproof of the vulgar error that age is the mother of wisdom
than this, that the older the race grows the less it attends
to them: or rather, whilst it attends to them more and
more sedulously up to a certain critical hour—reached by
the Greeks (say) 400 <span class="f8">B.C.</span>, and by Western Europe (say)
<span class="f8">A.D.</span> 1600—it then begins to disregard, rapidly neglects them,
till in a comparatively short time what is called the “enlightened”
part of mankind forgets to take account of them
at all; although it is well known that an eclipse of the moon
a little before sunrise in the sign of Leo was a token that
Darius should be defeated at Arbela; that on the first day
that Julius Cæsar sat on the golden throne and wore the
purple robe, an ox, having been sacrificed, was found to have
no heart—at which Cæsar himself was surprised, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
after he was assassinated; and that many signs and wonders
announced quite recently the coming of the Spaniards into
Mexico; Montezuma had visions and grew melancholy; the
idol of Quetzalchoatl declared that a strange people approached
to possess his kingdom, and so did witches and
sorcerers; a stone spoke and warned him; a lake overflowed
its banks; a pyramid of fire was seen in the sky; monsters
were born with two heads, and there were other portents,
all to no purpose.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>Omens, enjoyed with fear and trembling by all men in all
ages, have sometimes been conceived of as due to magical
power, but much more generally as the sendings of demons
or gods; although the fact that they are rarely of any use
to the recipient, or even intelligible to him until after the
event, makes it very improbable that they involve the intervention
of any intelligent cause. And what are we to think
of the intelligence of mankind, who in spite of their experience
of omens during so many ages, were still eager to observe
them?</p>


<h3><a id="ch07_02"></a>§ 2. Omens and Natural Signs</h3>

<p>For the wild man seeking game or on the alert for enemies
it is necessary to read every sign of the presence of enemies
or of game in the neighbourhood: footprints, broken twigs
and bent grass, droppings of feathers, hair or dung, remnants
of food or marks of habitation instantly catch his eye; noises
or odours arrest his other senses. His world is full of these
signs, and he must always be on the watch for them: the
birds being suddenly silent, on looking up he sees a hawk;
a change of wind, or the aspect of clouds, announces rain or
fair weather; the coming and departure of certain birds—as
with us the swallow and the cuckoo—portend the change
of seasons. In all these cases causation is active and sometimes
obvious, but often very obscure: the apparent may
be the reverse of the real order: for the coming of swallows
is the antecedent of our enjoying the summer; but in the
order of nature the course of the seasons determines the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
migration of birds. That the true relation may be misunderstood
is shown by the behaviour of certain Australian
natives who, noticing that plovers cry before the coming of
rain, take their cry to be a cause of rain, and therefore imitate
it when performing their rain-rites.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> We may observe how
obscure is the distinction between sign and cause even
amongst ourselves, in the general belief that “a change of
the moon” is connected somehow with a change of weather;
for what the relation is no one seems clearly to conceive.</p>

<p>The relation between natural signs and the events signified,
being obscure, may be mysterious; and accordingly
its obscurity has been made use of to defend the belief in
Omens. In the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Divinatione</cite><a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> Quintus, who is unkindly
given by his brother the post of apologist for all that nonsense,
(following, I suppose, the sophistry of some Stoic)
quotes Aratus’ description of how certain movements of the
sea presage a coming storm; the gull, too, and the crow by
their behaviour: and the croaking of frogs and the snuffing
of cattle foretell rain. I cannot explain, he says, how animals
have such knowledge any more than I can explain the divinations
of augurs; nor is it necessary to do so: in both cases
there are the facts.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that the savage, depending for his life
upon a knowledge of signs, driven by eagerness and anxiety
to observe them, and unable to distinguish coincidence from
causation and the entanglements of causation, should imagine
himself to have discovered many more signs than are comprised
in the order of nature. Thus in Torres Straits, the
biro-biro announces by its arrival that yams are ready for
eating (which seems needless), and the cry of the koko
predicts fine weather (which is credible); but, further, the
sunbird can foretell the coming of a boat,<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and that must
be imagination.</p>


<h3><a id="ch07_03"></a>§ 3. Some Signs Conceived of as Magical</h3>

<p>Very gradually, we may suppose, a difference came to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
felt between two classes of signs: (1) those that are of a
usual kind, such as the tracks of game, the return of the
swallows, the croaking of frogs, which are almost constantly
the antecedents of interesting events, such as the getting of
food, the coming of spring, or of rain; sequences that recur
again and again, some of them being, like the tracks of game,
easily intelligible; all which, accordingly, are accepted as
a matter of course and incorporated with common sense.
(2) Less usual events, such as strange animals, lightning,
eclipses, shooting-stars; which come to be considered as
signs by being connected in imagination with interesting
events which happen soon after them, such as a failure in
hunting, an attack by enemies, a death in the tribe, the
wreck of a canoe; though the connexions are irregular and
never intelligible, and are accepted not as a matter of course,
but as mysterious, magical and portentous: they are Omens.
They acquire the hold upon men that belongs to the growing
body of superstition. Although irregular, they are classed
with the connexions that are believed to be most regular,
and failures are overlooked. To these are added and accumulated
in tradition, by analogy or caprice, innumerable
other signs and warnings.</p>

<p>That Omens obtain an inextricable hold in the tangle of
superstitious beliefs results from men’s strong desire to
foresee the future, especially in social conditions full of dangers
and uncertainties, without the settled organisation which,
with us in ordinary times, makes one year so much like
another. Upon many people, indeed, this desire has the
same effect to this day, and becomes more active in troubled
times like the present. Anxious to know whether they are
to marry, or to hear of a death, or to come into money or
some other advancement, they hope to find out by visiting
Mrs. Sludge in a stuffy chamber, or (as you may see in
London) by consulting a canary at the street-corner. When
a fixed idea of love or ambition or anxiety possesses the
mind and leaves it no peace, we are ready to try any device
that promises to relieve the strain, and we do things sillier
than could have been predicted even by those who knew us
best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Belief in Omens and the practice of observing them
having been established, the list of portentous events grows
ever larger. (<i>a</i>) In a depressed frame of mind the future
looks gloomy; in exhilaration, cheerful. A sensation, such
as shivering, or sweating, that accompanies fear is apt to
excite fear. In fear or depression one acts feebly and fails;
in hope and confidence one acts vigorously and wins: the
expectations produced by such moods fulfil themselves,
and therefore the moods are ominous. This may be the
reason why, when men are at strife and some ambiguous
Omen occurs, he who first claims its favour or denounces
its menace upon his enemy, gains an advantage;<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> for the
other may be daunted and unable to rally his forces. But
that depends on character.</p>

<p>This subjective value of an Omen, making its virtue a
function of the recipient’s disposition, sometimes became so
prominent as to obscure its truly magical character; according
to which it must be indissolubly connected in some way with
the event and can have nothing to do with the recipient’s
attitude. Thus it might be held that an Omen, if it deeply
affected a man’s imagination, would be fulfilled; but, if
neglected, it might not be. Pliny says<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> that, according to
the augurs, auspices had no import for one who in any
enterprise declared that he would not regard them. Or,
again, the bearing of an Omen may be determined by the
way in which it is accepted: Julius Cæsar, landing in Africa,
fell; and that must have seemed a very bad Omen; but
he, having the presence of mind (though not exempt from
superstition) to exclaim: “Africa, I lay hold of thee!” changed
its significance;<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and, doubtless, greatly altered its effect
upon the minds of his officers and soldiers and of all who
heard of it; and that was the important matter. Hope and
desire and anxiety created Omens, and they had also the
power to direct the incidence and corrupt the interpretation
of Omens. In fact, there were conventional formulæ for
accepting good Omens and rejecting bad ones: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Accipio
omen, Absit omen, Tibi in caput redeat;</i> which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
counteractive spells; and it is agreed that Magic may be
overcome by stronger Magic.</p>

<p>This attitude of mind that makes an Omen subject to its
acceptance, may explain the otherwise absurd practice of
taking the Omens again and again, when the earlier have
been unfavourable, until one is obtained that flatters the
inquirer’s hopes. Not only amongst sophisticated peoples,
who might be supposed to treat Omens in a formal and perfunctory
way, but even in the lower barbarism Omens are
thus garbled. The Karens of Borneo, consulting the liver
of a pig to authorise an expedition, if with one pig the appearance
is forbidding, sacrifice a second, third, or fourth; though
without a satisfactory forecast they will not set out. Then,
having set out, they try to avoid hearing the cry of the
woodpecker (which has two notes, the one of good, the other
of evil augury), lest it should be against their plans. And
the same simple-minded people believe in the magical
efficacy of the sign, no matter how obtained. Vaticinating
by the flight of a hawk, a man will try, by shouting and by
waving to it, to turn its flight toward the left, that being with
them the prosperous direction.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Imagination-beliefs are
saturated with insincerity; their unconscious maxim is,
“Believe as you list.”</p>

<p>Although it may be a general principle that savages are
more impressed by external than by internal experiences,
yet the suggestion of the foregoing paragraphs, that the
finding of Omens in one’s own sensations is secondary to,
and dependent on, the growth of a belief in Omens presented
by physical events, is not one upon which I much rely.
Possibly sensations and moods are a distinct and primitive
source of this superstition: for it has been noticed in Australia,
where the lore of Omens in general has made but little
progress. Whilst performing tribal ceremonies under strong
emotion, the aborigines think that their entrails sometimes
acquire “sight”; so that they know whether their wives
have been unfaithful, or they feel the approach of danger.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
In the Western Isles of Torres Straits shivering and uneasy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
feelings are presentiments; and in the Eastern Isles, a
dryness of one’s skin or sneezing:<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> in New Guinea, if the
right shoulder ache, expect good news; if the left, bad.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
And these simplest of all whims are the longest lived; for
amongst ourselves many a woman suddenly has a presentiment,
“as if some one were walking over her grave.”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) As a mood of elation or depression is itself ominous,
so is whatever excites such a mood. Depressing objects
are cripples, old women, sick people, timid hares, loathsome
toads, a snake coming to meet a war-party, discouraging
words, ugly dreams; whereas pleasant dreams, encouraging
words, a snake going before us as against the enemy, hawks,
wolves and blooming youth are all exhilarating: the list
varies from tribe to tribe. Many ominous things promise
good or evil according as they appear on the right hand or
on the left: the left being generally held inauspicious,
because (it is said) the left hand is the clumsier and weaker;
and this may be true. But we have seen that in Borneo the
left is preferred; and whereas the Greeks followed the general
rule, assigning evil to the left hand, the Romans thought
the right hand was the direction of danger. And this contrariety
has been explained as due to a difference of orientation
in the formal taking of Omens; for the Greek then faced
northward, and had the place of sunrise upon his right hand;
whilst the Roman faced southward and had on his right
hand the place of sunset: so that it was not anything to do
with his own body, but the direction whence the sun appeared
and advanced with growing power and splendour which
each of them judged of good hope, in contrast with that
whither the sun declined and weakened to his death. To
illustrate these fancies would be an endless task, and a
superfluous labour, since nothing is better known.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Coincidence, the occurrence near together of two
interesting events, is sure to make people think there must
be some connexion between them; and the earlier event
will be classed, according to circumstances, as either a cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
or a sign of the later; and if the connexion is mysterious, it
must be either a magical power like that of a talisman, or
that special kind of Magic which is an Omen. What circumstances
determine this distinction, I will presently try
to show. Possibly all Omens that are not derived from
subjective moods and sensations, or from things or events
that excite such moods, were originally founded upon coincidence.
Upon this, apparently, the Egyptians relied in
the records they kept (according to Herodotus) of Omens
and their fulfilment; and Quintus Cicero is represented<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> as
believing that the Babylonians kept such records for 470,000
years: so that it was, in their view, an inductive science;
but we never hear of their having kept a record of failures
and disappointments.</p>

<p>Some Omens having been established by subjective prognostication
or by coincidence, many more may be added by
analogy, or by a sort of reasoning. An analogy with the
contrast of right and left hand may be noticed in all opposites:
the woodpecker in Borneo, for example, having two
cries, and one of them a warning, must not the other be an
encouragement? The belief in Omens having taken hold of
the public mind, everybody is on the look-out for signs and
wonders; and anything unusual seen, or heard, or rumoured,
becomes a possible Omen of anything else, and men ask one
another what it portends. The superstitious imagination is
greedy of its accustomed food. Under such conditions, too,
Omens are discovered by retrospection: a public calamity,
such as the death of a king, the defeat of an army, or a pestilence
(or in private life some private misfortune), makes us
remember some foregoing event or events, which must have
forewarned us, had we had the skill to interpret the significance
of Time’s progression.</p>


<h3><a id="ch07_04"></a>§ 4. Differentiation of Omens from General Magic</h3>

<p>The savage mind, sensitive to the resemblance of relations,
cannot overlook the analogy between signs and warning
cries; many Omens are cries; and with the spread of animistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
explanation, they came to be considered as the
sendings of spirits or gods. But, at first, by mere magical
thinking, under the stress of anxiety to know the future,
and the helplessness of common sense to predict anything
outside the everyday routine, Omens are gradually separated
from ordinary probable signs (such as the tracks of game)
as necessary infallible signs (or tendencies) if cunning can
find them out, connected by some supernatural law with
the unknown future that certainly awaits us, and as a kind
of Magic. The magical habit of mind may be supposed to
have resulted from the coalescence of beliefs concerning
several imaginary operations—by charms, spells, rites—each
class of beliefs having its own occasions, causes, or
fallacious grounds. Those operations had in common the
marks of being connexions of events due to imagined forces
of a mysterious kind, and therefore grouped themselves
together in men’s minds as the Magic apperception-mass.
Omens had these marks and, therefore, were assimilated to
Magic. An Omen is an event regarded as a magical sign of
the good or ill success of some undertaking, or of the approach
of good fortune, or of calamity. And on the principle that
ideas are differentiated from a confused matrix, it is probable
that Omens, having at first been confused with other magical
antecedents of events, were only gradually again distinguished
from them. But an important distinction existed and at
last came to light: charms, rites and spells are causes of
events; whereas Omens are signs only, not causes. The
difference is that whereas charms, rites and spells directly
exert their powers upon the course of things, Omens themselves
exert no power, but show only that there is some
power at work, which will have such or such results.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>Comparing Omens with other modes of Magic, several
peculiarities may be noticed: (<i>a</i>) Omens themselves (apart
from the preparation of victims, etc.) imply no human intervention,
whereas rites and spells must be performed or
recited by some one, and even charms are carried about one,
or used in rites, or solemnly affixed to doors, animals or other
possessions. (<i>b</i>) Partly as a consequence of this, Omens,
considered in themselves, generally (as I have said) convey
no suggestion of force. This cannot, indeed, be said of
eclipses and thunderstorms; but the note of a bird, the
appearance of entrails, a mere shivering or other change of
feeling, though ominous, suggests no energetic operation;
whilst rites and spells are often carried out with much expenditure
of energy, and even charms, though not obviously
active, are necessarily believed to be powerful in some
obscure way of their own. (<i>c</i>) Omens are often so remote
in time, as well as in place, from the events indicated that
any quasi-mechanical determination of the issue by them
can hardly be thought of; but with rites and spells, though
they may not operate openly in the hour of their setting to
work, yet the delay is not expected to be great, and (as said)
their impulsion or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisus</i> is often very impressive; and charms
are incessantly and immediately active. (<i>d</i>) Omens in
general do not foretell precisely what is to happen, but only
the success or failure of some enterprise (not the “how” of
it), happiness or misfortune; whereas rites and spells have
some definite object, and most charms inflict, or guard against,
some one kind of evil, disease or shipwreck; though others
(it is true) bring luck or loss at large. Thus Omens are very
different from other magical conditions; and although it is
not likely that the ordinary savage or even the wizard ever
consciously draws these distinctions or sums them up, still
they have an effect upon his mind, and the observation of
Omens and the reading of them becomes at last a special
branch of the Magic Art—Divination.</p>


<h3><a id="ch07_05"></a>§ 5. Omens Interpreted by Animism</h3>

<p>Omens, then, being only signs and not causes of future
events, having no power in themselves, must be connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
with some efficient power, or else the events prognosticated
could not happen. How is that power to be understood?
For a long time, probably, there is no clear conception of it:
the connexion is mysterious. But there are two ways in
which it may be interpreted: (<i>a</i>) Following the impersonal
magical way of thinking, we are led to the idea of currents
of force in which both Omen and event are borne along;
and, at last, to the conception of a fatal order of the world
in which all events have their necessary places. There A
is always followed by B; so that, although A exerts no
power over B, yet (if we know the law of the sequence) when
the former appears it is an infallible portent of the latter.
The power at work is Fate; and to this idea I must return;
for in its full development it comes late in history.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The other and much simpler way of explaining Omens
is to attribute them to the intervention of spirits who,
whether they control events or not, at least foresee them,
and send messages of warning to mankind. With the spread
of Animism this is a matter of course. A sophisticated age
may ask how a spirit should be able to see the future; and
may answer that spirits, having greater knowledge than we
of the present state of the world and its laws of causation,
are able to calculate the outcome, just as an astronomer
foretells an eclipse of the sun. A precious rationalisation!
To the untutored savage there is no difficulty. To foresee
the future is a very common performance: whenever we
form an expectation which is fulfilled (and that happens
many times a day) we accomplish this feat; and for the
most part we are unconscious of the grounds upon which
we formed the expectation. The savage is always in this
position: he has not analysed the relation of “ground and
consequence” nor examined the mental conditions that
precede an inference. To him, therefore, foreknowledge,
within a certain range, is not even mysterious; and, of
course, spirits have the gift in a much higher degree. In
Melanesia a <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">vui</i> (spirit) knows secret things without seeing;<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
and here begins the rôle of intuition in Philosophy. Later, a
high god may give warnings, not merely of what he foresees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in the course of the world, but of what he of his own volition
will bring to pass; or a lesser god may announce what he
knows to be the will of the higher; or, later still, all spiritual
warnings may sink back into helpless incidents in the course
of Fate.</p>

<p>Omens (as has been mentioned) resemble warnings:
(<i>a</i>) Like warnings, they precede events, but do not cause
them. (<i>b</i>) They sometimes precede an event by a considerable
interval, as if to give time for precaution. (<i>c</i>) They
do not announce the details of any event (which a friendly
counsellor may not know), but only its character as good or
evil. Then, if they are warnings (implying foreknowledge),
since they are not the act of any man, they must be given
by some spirit or other intelligence. So that once a belief
in the intervention of spirits in mundane affairs has become
prevalent in any tribe, nothing can be more natural than to
regard Omens as spiritual messages. Still, this way of
thinking may have been preceded by a disposition to attribute
Omens to the good will of animals, especially Totems; for
animals are often wiser than we are. In Australia the
Turbal tribe held that the chirping of insects foretold the
coming of blacks; a Wakelbwa who dreamed of a kangaroo
would expect one of the Banbe subclass next day; to dream
of old-man kangaroos sitting round the fire presaged danger.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
Among the Yuin (Western Australia) a Black-Duck clansman
thought that black ducks warned him against enemies; and
men of the Kurnai, who had personal Totems, thought they
gave protection by warnings.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Very early, however, ghosts
or spirits sometimes come themselves to instruct us; as
amongst the Kurnai, the Biraark (wizards) hold <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séances</i> at
night, when ghosts attend, and give news of enemies or of
absent friends.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> In New Guinea, the ghosts of dead tribesmen
send their surviving relatives Omens by fishes or birds.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>By this animistic theory Omens are intimately connected
with Oracles and Dreams; for these, too, are messages from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the spirit-world. Dreams are the chief causes of belief in
spirits, and with many people have not yet lost the character
of supernatural visitations. Probably for ages past there
have been in each generation a few rationalists, who treated
dreams in the manner of Artabanes (as reported by Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>—who,
however, will show that the event refuted
him), holding that “whatever a man has been thinking of
during the day is wont to hover round him in the visions of
his dreams at night.” Incensed against the diviners, rationalists
have, in fact, too much despised and neglected
dreams.</p>

<p>Oracles and Dreams are amongst the phenomena of
“possession.” Spirits, demons, gods, roaming the world
and indwelling or haunting various bodies or localities,
sometimes take up their abode in stones or bags of charms,
which then become fetiches; or attain greater dignity in
images and temples; or enter into men and women, afflicting
them with diseases, or else with dreams, or drunkenness, or
madness, or prophecy, or poetry;<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> for these things are hard
to distinguish. And sometimes the people thus afflicted
wander at large, sometimes are to be found only by some
tree, or spring, or cave, or temple, where the spirit that makes
them wise above others has chosen to reside, perhaps because
his body was buried there.</p>

<p>Omens, Oracles and Dreams have, besides their dependence
on spirits, another trait in common, namely, obscurity of
meaning. When you have been favoured with one of these
communications, what does it promise or threaten? To
answer this question passes the wit of ordinary men; and,
therefore, certain superior minds assume the important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
function of Diviners and, to guide their judgment, work out
in course of ages with infinite ingenuity the Art of Divination.</p>


<h3><a id="ch07_06"></a>§ 6. Natural and Artificial Omens</h3>

<p>Before discussing Divination we had better remind ourselves
of the immense extension that the lore of Omens
undergoes beyond the early recognition of mysterious natural
signs (thunder or the behaviour of birds, etc.), by the preparation
in various ways of conditions under which Omens
may be obtained at will (throwing dice, roasting shoulder-blades,
sacrificing pigs, etc.). Men are eager to know the
future, at least the general complexion of it as happy or
unhappy; and for this purpose they desire Omens. But
natural Omens do not always appear when wanted, though
probably the mere desire of them has multiplied them
greatly; it is, therefore, very convenient to discover devices
by which Omens can always be obtained by any one for any
purpose. A common practice is to toss a halfpenny, and
decide a doubtful choice of action by head or tail: reinforcing
imbecility with superstition. It is impossible we should
ever learn how such conventions originated, but may assume
that the earlier were suggested by some accident, and many
of the later by analogy. The Warramunga have a very
simple plan, when a man dies, for discovering who it was
that by evil magic slew him. They smooth the ground
about the spot where the death occurred, and next morning
come to examine it; and if they find there the trail of a
snake, they know that the murderer was a man of the Snake-totem.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
It is reasonable to suppose that in the first instance
they found such a trail of snake or other animal upon unprepared
ground, and thereafter smoothed the ground to make
such signs plainer: thus they began the preparation of conditions
for the taking of Omens. A New Zealand wizard
had a simple construction for discovering beforehand who
would have the better of a battle: he set up two sticks near
together, one for his own party, the other for the enemy,
and let them fall: whichever stick fell on the top of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the party it had stood for was to conquer in the fight.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> As
ages go by and more and more intellect is concentrated upon
the problem of foreknowledge, more and more ways are discovered
of preparing the conditions of taking Omens, more
and more expensive and complicated ones; for the more
difficult the preparation and interpretation, the more necessary
it is to employ a professional augur. The casting of
dice, the drawing of lots, the taking of one’s chance with
verses of Virgil or of the Bible, may seem easy, but even
such devices may be made difficult by accumulating rules of
interpretation. The sacred chicken, whose vagaries in
feeding occasionally relieve with grateful diversion the
strenuous page of Roman History, cannot have required
highly skilled manipulation, but to watch them a professional
eye was necessary; and when sacrifices are employed as
opportunities of taking Omens from the behaviour of the
victims, the manner of their dying and the condition of their
entrails, a technical specialist of high training becomes
indispensable. This led to the intensive study of entrails,
especially of livers (Hepatoscopy, Hepatomancy), with some
gain of knowledge in Anatomy. The study was widely
diffused; but still more widely, perhaps, the art of prophesying
by the lines to be observed in shoulder-blades cracked by
roasting over a fire (Scapulomancy).</p>

<p>Where nothing is or can be done to alter the physical
conditions of premonitory signs, yet a painstaking analysis
has been made of those conditions in order to interpret them
in a methodical way; and this study may demand far greater
skill than augury. In Cheiromancy the lines and eminences
of the hand have been exactly mapped and defined, and have
had their several values and meanings assigned. It is really
a perplexing study, not to be entered upon with a light heart,
yet simple and obvious in comparison with Astrology. The
Astrologer who would undertake to forecast the future fate
of men or nations, or to recover forgotten facts of antiquity,
such as the date of a hero’s birth (for it was understood that
a difference of forward or backward in time should not
hinder scientific calculations), had to take account of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the visible furniture of heaven, the stars in their constellations,
especially the signs of the Zodiac; the seven planets, each
with its own qualities and powers assumed arbitrarily or
by fanciful analogies, all unquantified and all varying in the
Twelve Houses of Heaven. What learning, what stupendous
abilities were demanded for such a task! In fact, any one
who now hears of it, immediately knows it to be impossible.
But until many problems had been solved and the method
of them appreciated, no one could understand what kind
of problems are insoluble. Meanwhile, in this study, for
ages so honoured, a mixture of genuine Astronomy and a
parade of systematic procedure (of which philosophers well
know the force) made fatuity plausible.</p>


<h3><a id="ch07_07"></a>§ 7. Divination and Oracles</h3>

<p>Omens and Oracles are, no doubt, infallible premonitions
of something, if one can find it out; but they are often so
obscure or ambiguous that one gets no guidance from them,
and indeed it is sometimes impossible to judge whether they
are ever fulfilled, or not. It is, therefore, most important
that some one should be able to expound them; and here, as
in every department of human effort, we may be sure that,
of the many who attempt interpretation, one will be more
successful than others; and then to him all men flock for
enlightenment, especially if he make one good guess about
some Omen or Oracle of general interest. Such a man was
thereby constituted a Diviner, and became the founder of a
profession, or (at least) of a branch or function of the great
wizardly profession. It happened long ago; for in savagery
most wizards are already Diviners.</p>

<p>In course of time the profession can no longer be satisfied
with interpretation by guesswork, but elaborates the principles
of the subject, the Art of Divination, upon which,
perhaps, as much painstaking and ingenuity have been
expended as upon industry and science put together. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> who carried out such work were probably (many of
them) as honest as fanatics can be; but the result always was
to raise the reputation of the profession for occult knowledge
and mysterious insight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Diviners are either free and independent seers, soothsayers,
fortune-tellers, mostly poverty-stricken and disreputable,
though sometimes eminent and influential, like
Tiresias and Epimenides; or else officials (a much smaller
party) attached to some temple or government. Official
soothsayers have often exercised immense power in society
and politics. They are not found, of course, at the bottom
of the scale of culture, where there is no government in
Church or State; but in the lower barbarism, among the
Bantu tribes (for example), Diviners have a highly influential
station. The chief of a tribe usually has a specially trusted
Diviner, and also consults others in discovering sorcerers
and in forecasting the future.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> In the Mazwaya clan of the
Thonga there is an official Diviner who alone knows the exact
composition of the royal “medicine,” on which the welfare
of the whole tribe depends. He is very much feared: no
one dares dispute with him; and he has the right of cursing
even the chief himself.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Such a powerful subject naturally
excites the jealousy of the chief, who sometimes endeavours
to get into his own hands all the medicines and occult virtues
possessed by any of his tribesmen.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> The danger of opposition
between Church and State was also felt in Melanesia
and Polynesia; and in Hawaii it was decisively overcome;
for when the oracle was to be consulted, the king, concealed
in a frame of wickerwork, gave the responses himself.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>In Greece (sixth and fifth centuries <span class="f8">B.C.</span>) oracles were still
more powerful: the record may be read in Herodotus.
The most flourishing States observed the Omens, and never
ventured to go to war without consulting the Oracles; and
the Oracles undertook to advise on war and peace and
alliances, to settle disputed claims to sovereignty and the
constitution of States, to sanction new laws and the foundation
of colonies, to order the erection of new temples and
even the worship of new deities—some of them of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
dubious reputation: to say nothing of the infinite extent of
their private practice. Their utterances were often unintelligible;
they were sometimes known to have accepted
bribes; yet the most enlightened people in the world continued
to consult them: whether in good faith, or for their
effect upon the vulgar both friends and enemies, or perhaps
to share responsibility for an action with the gods, or even
because one then felt more comfortable than in leaving them
alone. But the diffusion of philosophy was too much for
them; and, as Cicero says,<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> even the Delphic Oracle declined
in reputation, not because with lapse of time the divine
virtue failed of those exhalations that inspired the priestess,
but when men became less credulous. Perhaps it was also
because social life had become, under Roman government,
safer and more settled and regular; so that a reasonable
amount of foresight could be exercised without supernatural
aid. Still, after the Oracles seemed to have been struck
dumb, they revived from time to time for two or three
centuries; Plutarch was far from incredulous; and the equivalent
of them will (I suppose) continue to revive now and then,
unless insane desire, and anxiety, and pusillanimity, and
wonder and confusion of mind shall one day be extinguished.</p>

<p>In the great empires of the higher barbarism, the Magi
amongst the Medes and Persians, and in Egypt, Babylonia
and India the priesthood who practised soothsaying and
vaticination with their other functions, obtained still greater
control over national life. The development of Astrology
has always been imputed to the Chaldeans; and the importance
of dreams and their interpretation in Egypt and
Babylon is reflected in the stories of Joseph and Daniel as
well as in the profaner pages of Herodotus.</p>

<p>The character of Omens and the way of obtaining Oracles
and of being inspired in Greece were merely modifications of
those that have been in vogue amongst savages. Imagination-beliefs,
in spite of their extravagance, have, in fact, a short
tether and move in narrow circles, perpetually renewing the
same themes. The ravings of the Pythoness possessed,
which are said to have sometimes frightened the priests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
might have been studied in Fiji. This was what happened
when a priest was inspired: he “becomes absorbed in
thought ... in a few minutes he trembles; slight distortions
are seen in his face, and twitching movements in his
limbs. These increase to a violent muscular action, which
spreads until the whole frame is violently convulsed, and
the man shivers as with a strong ague-fit. In some instances
this is accompanied by murmurs and sobs; the veins are
greatly enlarged, and the circulation of the blood quickened.
The priest is now possessed by his god, and all his words and
actions are considered as no longer his own, but those of
the deity who has entered him. Shrill cries of Koi au!
Koi au! ‘It is I! It is I!’ fill the air, and the god is
supposed thus to notify his approach. While giving the
answer the priest’s eyes stand out and roll as in a frenzy;
his voice is unnatural, his face pale, his lips livid, his breathing
depressed and his entire appearance that of a furious madman.
The sweat runs from every pore, the tears start from his
strained eyes; after which the symptoms gradually disappear.
The priest looks round with a vacant stare, and as
the god says ‘I depart,’ announces his actual departure by
violently flinging himself down on the mat, or by suddenly
striking the ground with a club.... The convulsive movements
do not entirely disappear for some time.”<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>To become inspired by means of visions or dreams, or
endowed with the powers of a prophet or diviner, the obvious
plan is to go to places frequented by spirits, namely, tombs,
caves and temples. The Oracle of Trophonius in Bœotia
was situated in a cave into which the consultant descended,
and there saw visions or heard strange noises, and lost his
senses: on returning to the upper air, he sat in the Chair of
Memory and reported to the priests what had happened;
and they delivered him to his friends “overpowered with
fear, and quite unconscious of himself and his surroundings.”<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
Afterwards he recovered his wits. At Oropus was a sanctuary
of Amphiaraus, who (against his better judgment)
had joined the expedition of Adrastus against Thebes and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
amidst the general defeat of the army, fled and was swallowed
up in the earth. His death ought to have occurred where
his sanctuary stood; for it was a famous Oracle, and to consult
it you purified yourself and sacrificed a ram and, spreading
the skin under you, went asleep there, awaiting a revelation
in a dream.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> In the temple of Pasiphæ, too, near Sparta,
one might hope for a divine message in a dream; and a
shepherd, sleeping by the grave of Orpheus at Libethra, was
moved to sing the verses of Orpheus.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>To lose one’s memory and afterwards recover one’s wits
is incidental to many initiation ceremonies, and the darkness
and secrecy of caves—which, moreover, are often burial-places—have
always deeply impressed our imagination.
Amongst the Arunta there is a way of obtaining powers of
Magic and Divination by going to sleep at the mouth of a
cave; when the Iruntarinia (a kind of spirits), who live there,
pierce the sleeper’s head with lances, drag him into the cave,
disembowel him and give him new entrails. He awakes
dazed and silly; and the spirits lead him home, where
gradually he recovers his right mind.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Amongst the Kurnai,
again, one may become a wizard and diviner by sleeping at
a grave; for in the night the dead man disembowels one,
and provides new visceral organs.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Elsewhere in Australia
a candidate for the wizardly profession is tied down at night
in the tribal burial-ground and visited by spirits who force
a stone into his head—apparently a kind of crystal, by
gazing into which a wizard is able to see the past, the distant
and the future.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>The seeking of enlightenment where spirits dwell in caves
or graves, loss of wits by contact with them and subsequent
recovery—all this may remind us of stories in Pausanias;
but what of the disembowelling and renewing of the viscera?
We are told by Spencer and Gillen that during the performance
of certain traditionary ceremonies, an Australian’s
emotion is very great, so that he says his inward parts get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
“tied up in knots,” and sometimes acquire “sight” and give
omens;<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and Howitt tells us that fat of the kidneys is believed
to be the seat of a man’s prowess and other virtues.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> To
extract and renew a man’s entrails, therefore, is to renew
his spirit, just as we speak metaphorically of a “change of
heart,” so that he has more vivid emotions, firmer courage,
clearer insight. In fact, it is the magical equivalent of
inspiration; the crystal, too, of the Euahlayi is a magic
source; and this is as far as the Australians have got:<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
gross materialism, which the progress or (at least) the movement
of animistic thought has happily superseded by
conceptions more refined, if not more truthful.</p>


<h3><a id="ch07_08"></a>§ 8. Apparent Failure of Omens</h3>

<p>Though in their nature infallible, Omens are not always
fulfilled—at least, their fulfilment is not always ascertainable.
But this is easily explained; for whatever an Omen may be
in itself, our knowledge of it depends on observation, which
may be superficial and incomplete, so that we may not
know what it was. What kind of bird was it? Which way
did it fly? How many cries did it utter? These questions
go to the heart of the matter; yet each of them points out
an opportunity of error. But granting the observations
perfect, we have still to learn what the Omen portends;
and although a simple mind, trusting to simple rules, may
be ready offhand with an answer, it becomes, with the
development of the art of Divination, more and more complicated
and difficult, demanding long experience and profound
erudition—something worth paying for. It is popularly
known that dreams are perplexing as the guide of life. Are
they to be accepted at face value, or do they go by contraries?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
What difference does it make whether they happen early in
the night, or in the morning, or whether we sleep in white
or in coloured night-clothes? There is an extensive casuistry
of this matter. Interpretations of Omens proceeded generally
by analogy: the length and direction of the cracks in
a shoulder-blade indicate the length and tenor of a man’s
life. Oracles, again, were often distractingly obscure; from
Delphi much like riddles; but those of Zeus at Dodona are
said to have been sometimes taken to Apollo at Delphi to
ask what they meant. Clearly, then, besides possible errors
of observation, there were further pitfalls of interpretation;
if a physician or a pilot is sometimes out in his reckoning,
why not also a diviner? So that an Omen might very well
be fulfilled without our knowing exactly what it was or what
it indicated.</p>

<p>But that is not all; for we have seen that any kind of
magical force is only infallible as a tendency; it may be
counteracted, and this is generally thought to be the case
with Omens. Just as the rites of one magician may be
frustrated by the more powerful operations of another, so
an Omen indicates a course of events which may, perhaps,
be turned aside. That which is foreseen by one spirit may
be prevented by another, whose intervention was not foreseen;
for spirits are by no means infallible. Hence, however
well observed and interpreted, the tendency of an Omen, or
of the force it manifests, may be diverted or reversed by
some unknown cause. Moreover, we ourselves are loth to
relinquish all control over affairs. We have seen that the
efficacy of Omens depended (not without reason) on the
way they were received; and that we may meet them with
our own magical influence, accepting them, or rejecting with
a spell.</p>

<p>And further, we have seen that Magic often works by
symbols, and that a symbolic action will cause or incite a
real event; and similarly it is believed that the event foreshown
by an Omen may be symbolically fulfilled; that some
harmless semblance of the event may be substituted for it,
absorb (as it were) the poison of the menace and let the
threatened man go free. Astyages dreamed a dream which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the Magi interpreted to mean that the child of his daughter
(married to a Persian) should reign over Asia in his stead—implying
that the kingdom must pass from the Medes.
He therefore took measures to have the child destroyed;
but by a series of happy chances Cyrus, the child, escaped
and grew up; and in his boyhood Astyages discovered who
he was, and was greatly alarmed. So he sent again for the
Magi; but they, on learning that the boys in the village
where Cyrus had been reared had in games appointed him
their king, decided that this fulfilled the dream; for, said
they, “he will not reign a second time.”<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> So Cyrus lived,
and the lordship of Asia passed to the Persians; for the Magi
in this case overestimated the value of symbols. But all
these ways of frustrating an Omen are incompatible with
the interpretation of them by the course of Fate, and are
only fit to be believed in by the weaker brethren.</p>


<h3><a id="ch07_09"></a>§ 9. Apology for Omens</h3>

<p>It may be some excuse for Omens that the interpretation
of them was a sort of gymnastic for ingenuity, and was a
means by which the quick-witted maintained themselves in
a world of violence. It is, moreover, the business of those
who undertake such work to study social and political conditions,
just as rain-doctors study the weather. Their
judgment, therefore, may often be better than that of men
immersed in affairs and biassed by particular interests.
Even in the lower savagery diviners manage to know more
than others. In Queensland, when a big mob has assembled
at a camp, diviners are believed to keep their eyes and ears
open, sleepless—to learn who have death-bones, who has
operated with one, who has been pointed at, etc.;<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and in
South Africa (two or three steps higher in culture) diviners
take pains to obtain information as a means of “opening
the gates of distance.”<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> At Delphi, also, news was welcome
from all parts, and men of capacity kept a steady eye upon
the affairs of Greece and Asia. Of course, Divination, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
every other superstition, was exploited by politicians. The
Roman Government, according to Cicero, maintained the
College of Augurs for the advantage of the State in civil
affairs, although in his time the leaders of armies had ceased
to consult the Omens:<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and Polybius thought that religion
was Rome’s most useful institution.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> A law that the comitia
should not be held when Jupiter thundered and lightened
was especially convenient when that assembly was inconvenient;
for the official whose function it was had only to
declare that he saw lightning, and thereupon the comitia
broke up. Probably even those who thus abused a superstition,
yet believed (at least in times of danger) “there was
something in it.” Omens and Oracles were sought after to
allay fear and to gain confidence, and often they gave confidence
and the strength that goes with confidence; or
perhaps the rashness and folly that go with confidence, and
so betrayed the devotee; or, again, they dashed the courage
of brave men, and spread dismay, distrust and weakness.</p>

<p>No superiority of mere intellect seems to ensure men against
participating in these delusions. Many Stoics, though highly
disciplined in Logic, upheld the practices of Divination and
Astrology. Panætius, indeed, rejected them; and Epictetus
on moral grounds discouraged Divination. “For,” said he,
“what the diviner foresees is not what really concerns us.
We have within us a diviner who tells us what good and evil
are, and what are the signs of them. Does the diviner
understand that—after all his studies of the viscera? Not
what is to happen in the future, but to do as we ought whatever
happens is our true concern.”<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> But this genuine expression
of Stoic thought was abandoned by most of the sect in
their desire to defend as much as possible the popular religion.
They even staked the existence of the gods upon the genuineness
of Divination: arguing that if Divination exists there
must be gods who send Omens; and that if Divination does
not exist there can be no gods—since if there are gods who
know the future, and have a regard for mankind, and are
able to give warnings, they will certainly do so. Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
no Divination, no gods.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> There is, indeed, a widespread
pitiful persuasion that some provision must have been made
whereby a man may foresee his future; and so, in a sense,
there is; for the existence of order in nature implies the
possibility of foresight; and a fanciful mind might regard
Divination as the anticipatory manifestation of an instinct
in play before the faculties became capable of serious exercise.
But the play was taken too seriously; and the worst
of it was that its inane methods diverted attention from the
only possible method—if not always on the part of the
diviner, at least on the part of the great multitude, his dupes.
M.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;A. Jounod says of the Bantu tribes, “Divination kills
any attempt to use reason or experience in practical life.”<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
And, clearly, this is everywhere its tendency, be it a question
of consulting a canary at the street-corner, whether or not
we should marry, or an augur rather than an experienced
general whether or not now to engage the enemy.</p>

<p>Seneca<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> treated Omens as a necessary consequence of
universal Fate: for if all events are factors of one predetermined
order, everything in the present is a sign or
omen of everything to occur in the future; and some events,
such as the flight of birds, have been selected as Omens,
merely because the meaning or consequents of these happen
to have been observed; and whether Omens are respected
or despised, Fate determines the whole course of events.
By this way of thinking, as it was fated that the Romans
should be defeated at Lake Trasimenus, it was also fated
that the Omens should be declared unfavourable and that
the warning should not be taken; and if it was fated that
the Romans should be defeated at Cannæ, it was also fated
that the Omens should be declared favourable and that
they should be accepted. A belief in Fate makes Omens
useless.</p>

<p>If, however, instead of Fate (all-comprehensive Magic) or
predestination (by a supreme God), we regard the course of
the world as determined by natural causation, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Omens or Oracles may be useful or not (supposing them
possible) depends on the nature of the event foretold—on
whether it involves ourselves conditionally only or unconditionally.
Omens that warn us against events conditionally
may be useful enough, and few will think it a serious fault
that they discourage the use of reason. King Deiotarus,
having set out on a journey, was warned by an eagle not to
go forward with it, and he turned back; and that same night
the house at which he was to have slept fell down; so he
escaped.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The danger was conditional on his continuing the
journey; and, in the course of causation, a warning of
danger, whether announced by an augur or by our own
sagacity, may often enable us to avoid it. The causes of
the future are present, and (within certain limits) are in our
power. If I have reason to believe that there will be a fire
at the Opera to-night, or have a presentiment of some
calamity there, I need not go; and, then, I shall not be
burnt alive. Whether the presage come to me by an Omen,
or by a message from a god, or in an anonymous letter from
one of the incendiaries who happens to be a friend of mine,
cannot matter. No, if there were gods with intuitions of
futurity, or with better knowledge than we have of present
fact and greater power of calculating the consequences,
they might make themselves useful. On this hypothesis
there is not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> any absurdity in the doctrine of Omens.</p>

<p>But with Omens or Oracles of magical or divine authority,
that foreshadow our own fate unconditionally, the case is
different. If, for example, they tell a man that he will die
by the fall of the roof of his own house, that must be his
end; and any one who examines his career afterwards will
find that all his efforts to escape, all his pusillanimous
crouchings and windings, were just so many steps of causation
upon the road to inevitable doom. To convey such a
presage serves no purpose but to fill the victim’s last days
with anxiety and dread: it is as bad as cruelty to animals.</p>

<p>The defence of Omens is mere rationalisation. They took
possession of men’s minds not in an age of reason, but when
beliefs were freely born of hope and fear, were entirely practical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
were never thought out and never verified. Whether
the connection of Omen with event was conceived of magically
or animistically, it was always mysterious, and on that
account was the more impressive and acceptable. The
uniformity of such connexions was, indeed, assumed—otherwise
they were useless; the same bird’s call on this
hand or on that had always the same significance; but each
case at first stood by itself; it was what we call “a miracle.”
Even such assumption of causation in ordinary cases as
common sense implies did not compel the reflection that
each cause must itself be an effect of other causes, and so
again, and so on for ever. Nor did the assumption that
spirits could foresee the future require that they should
foresee the whole future, so as to imply an inviolable order
of the world. Such considerations were left to amuse or
perplex a later age. A great advance is marked by the
saying of the Bechuana prince to Casalis, that “one event is
the son of another, and we must never forget the genealogy.”<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
But quite recently amongst ourselves causation was so
feebly appreciated, even by the most educated, that testimony
concerning miracles could still be appealed to as a
ground for believing something further. One reviews all
these wonderful fossils of the soul which are dead and yet
alive, not without sympathy. For myself, I am free to
confess, as they used to say in Parliament, that Omens and
presentiments still haunt the shadowy precincts of imagination
with vague shapes and mutterings of evils to come; which
when they approach will be (I suppose) as hard and definite
as daylight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<br />THE MIND OF THE WIZARD</h2>


<h3><a id="ch08_01"></a>§ 1. The Rise and Fall of Wizardry</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> describing the occult arts and those who practise them,
terms are so loosely used that it may be convenient to
premise that by “Wizard” (or Medicine-man) is here meant
either a magician or a sorcerer; that is, either one who
puts into operation impersonal magical forces (or so far as
he does so), or one who relies upon the aid (or so far as he
does so) of ghosts or spirits under magical control. It is an
objection to this use of the word “sorcerer,” that it is often
applied to those chiefly whose practice is maleficent: but
there seems to be no word used only in the more general
sense; and the difference between maleficent and beneficent
wizards, whether magicians or sorcerers, will here be marked,
when necessary, by the familiar epithets “black” and
“white.”</p>

<p>In backward societies, wizardry is, or may be, practised
by every man or woman; and, indeed, in its simpler operations
or observances this is true at every stage of culture.
But in every kind of task it appears that some men can do
it better than others, and they attract the attention of the
rest; and probably this is the beginning of the differentiation
of the professional wizard: he is at first merely one whom
others ask to help them in certain matters, because they
believe that he, more than themselves, has the knack of
it. As the occult arts become complicated and dangerous
the superiority of the master-mind is more manifest. We
are told that amongst the Tasmanians there were no professional
wizards or medicine-men, but that some people
practised more than others. From the beginning the art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
excites wonder, and wonder credulity; and an old fellow,
who was subject to fits of contraction in the muscles of one
breast, used this mysterious affection to impose upon his
neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Wonder and the deference it brings with it,
with the self-delusion of power it generates, are at first the
wizard’s sole recompense; and to the end they remain his
chief recompense. In Australia a wizard is initiated (in fact
or by repute), and is in some ways a man apart from others;
yet in several cases it is reported that he receives no fees.
For magical services amongst the Arunta “no reward of any
kind is given or expected.”<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Sometimes a wizard expects
no fee unless he is successful, as among the Tungus, Yakut
and Buryats.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Generally, the wizard earns his living like
other men, and merely supplements it by fees and presents.
He rarely attains the professional dignity of living solely by
his art and mystery.</p>

<p>Nevertheless in simple societies the wizard is a leader or
a chief. The predominance of old men in council depends
upon their occult powers rather than upon their worldly
wisdom: even hereditary chiefs may have greater prestige
through Magic than through royal descent.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> I conceive
that after the organisation of the primitive hunting-pack
had, by various causes, been weakened or destroyed, it was
through belief in Magic that some sort of leadership and
subordination were re-established: perhaps in many experimental
social forms, of which some specimens may be found
in Australia and survivals of others in all parts of the world.
Among the Massim of the Trobriand Islands, hereditary
chieftainship is better developed than anywhere to the south
or west; yet “at the back of every chief’s power over his
people is the dread of sorcery, without which I feel sure he
is little more than a cypher.”<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Or the medicine-man may
appear as the chief’s rival, as among the Indians of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
upper Amazons described by Capt. Whiffen, who observes
that in a contest between the medicine-man and the chief
the odds are in favour of the former, since to his opponents
death comes speedily (by poison). He has great influence
over international policy: war is never made without his
advice. Here we see the beginning of that struggle between
the temporal and spiritual powers which continues with
alternate victory and defeat through the whole course of
history. Callaway<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> describes a Bantu chief as inducted to
his office by diviners that he may be “really a chief” not
merely by descent. A dangerous concession! But other
Bantu chiefs are themselves wizards, and strive to collect
all the medicine of the tribe in their own hands; and Chaka
declared he was the only diviner in the country.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> The rise
and spread of the political power of wizards, however, has
been fully illustrated by Sir J.&nbsp;G. Frazer in the sixth chapter
of <cite>The Magic Art</cite>.</p>

<p>As animistic interpretation prevails in any society, so
that the marvels of Magic come to be attributed to spiritual
causes, magicians tend to become sorcerers, and, being thus
associated with spirits, may not be easily distinguishable
from priests. Among the Buryat a shaman was a priest, as
knowing the will of the gods and directing sacrifices, but
he was also an exorcist and diviner.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The great majority
of those who deal with spirits rely, more or less openly,
upon both coercion and propitiation: but we may say
generally that an officiant is a sorcerer so far as he depends
upon coercing spirits by Magic; a priest so far as he relies
upon propitiating them by prayer and sacrifice. The sorcerer
is aggressive and domineering toward supernatural powers;
the priest professes humility. In any case the character
of a cult is liable, in course of time, to change from one side
to the other; and at the same time, two men may officiate
in the same rites and, at heart, one of them may be a priest
and the other a sorcerer. Custom gives the name of priest
to him who, when a certain stage has been reached in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
development of Animism, when gods are recognised, serves
and sacrifices to the more public and reputable spirits. A
conflict then breaks out between him and the sorcerer.</p>

<p>Whilst magic-beliefs greatly strengthen chieftainship,
religion, without impairing the magical sanction, reinforces it
with other ideas, and therefore has a political advantage.
A god is often the ancestor of the king and the ground of his
sovereignty; and the king himself, or his brother, may be
high-priest. The priesthood acquires commanding dignity;
it shares the culture of the highest social rank, and may
become almost the sole repository of learning and art.
Wizards then lose their place in the sun. The beneficent
practice of wizardry (or White Magic) is more or less incorporated
with religious rites; the maleficent practice (or
Black Magic) is forbidden and punished: under polytheism
because “it is destructive to human life or welfare”; under
monotheism, as offensive to God.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> The sorcerer is outlawed,
and betakes himself to the secret performance of unholy
rites in dark and unwholesome circumstances. He may be
in full antagonism to the official gods, invoking demons or
old down-trodden gods not yet forgotten by the people, and,
in the service of demons, inverting and profaning the rites
of public worship. But to forbid and punish the black art is
to punish crime, not to persecute Magic as such; whose
beneficent practices still flourish under another name. Prof.
Yrjö Hirn has shown that, during all the ignorant and superstitious
prosecutions of witches in Europe, the public religious
ceremonies and observances were permeated by magical
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> In spite of the antagonism between priest and
sorcerer, there is not the full opposition between Religion
and Sorcery that exists between Animism and Magic—between
the recognition of caprice and the belief in uniformity—since
the gods themselves work by Magic and
may be subject to its powers. It is not an antagonism of
principle, but partly of allegiance and partly of ambition.</p>

<p>The influence of wizards is generally extended by means
of clubs and secret societies: wizards form a marked class,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
are well aware of it, and are naturally drawn into mutual
understanding. In Australia no regular societies seem to
have existed, but the medicine-men recognised one another,
initiated and trained new-comers into the profession, had
an esoteric tradition of rites and methods and fictions, and
sometimes met for consultation. Among the savages of
Torres Straits, the <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">maidelaig</i> meet together in the bush at
night, in order to perform their sorcery, and the body of
sorcerers can control an individual <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">maidelaig</i>; but they
appear not to have a definitely organised society.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> In
Melanesia, however, many regular societies exist;<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> and
among the Northern Amerinds they were numerous and
powerful. The Midewinian society of the Ojibways is typical
of these institutions. It was the club of the legitimate
professionals, in contrast with private practitioners, who
were said (of course) to be favoured by evil <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">manidos</i>. To
join the society one must undergo instruction, paying fees
and making presents to its members. It comprised about
one-tenth of the tribe, and what with influence, what with
perquisites, did very well.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> In Africa also such societies
flourish.</p>

<p>Every profession, organised or unorganised, provided there
be an understanding amongst its members, is prone to acquire
anti-social interests and to establish a secret tradition; and
as long as moral sense is very imperfect, the antagonism of
the profession to the public may be a virulent evil, as we
see in the history of wizardry and priestcraft. Both the
profession and its tradition begin with practices common to
all members of a tribe; and the tradition grows by accumulating
the discoveries and inventions of the professionals.
Experiment and observation are employed by them (according
to their lights) probably from the first. Dr. Haddon
says that, in controlling the wind and rain, the procedure of
wizards in the eastern islands of Torres Straits was subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to variation, and so doubtless were the spells, and experts
relied on their own variants;<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> and Prof. Seligman<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> observes
that, in British New Guinea, the knowledge of “the departmental
expert” (wizard controlling rain, or fertility of garden,
or what not) is traditionary from father to son, consisting
partly of magical processes or formulæ, partly of the results
of years of observation and thought. All improvements in
science, art, industry and humbug are made by individuals.
The cumulative tradition becomes more voluminous, the
spells more intricate, the rites more elaborate; because the
possible membership of the profession is thereby narrowed,
the self-valuation of the initiated is heightened, the wonder
and credulity of the laity is enhanced: so much of the doctrine
and discipline being allowed to transpire as to make this
last effect a maximum. Whilst tribal belief in Magic is the
necessary ground of the wizard’s existence, he—being once
recognised—thenceforth confirms, sways and guides the
tribal belief.</p>


<h3><a id="ch08_02"></a>§ 2. The Wizard’s Pretensions</h3>

<p>Whilst societies are formed to promote the common interests
of wizards, too severe competition amongst themselves is in
some measure avoided by the specialisation of individuals in
different branches of their mystery. In pure Magic there is
some room for the division of labour to deal with the weather,
or fertility, or disease, but the spread of Animism and the
multiplication of fetiches and demons open to the sorcerers
a wide field for the multiplication of specialists. Amongst the
Beloki, says Mr. Weeks,<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> there are eighteen classes of specialists;
on the lower Congo, fifty.</p>

<p>By spells and rites and charms wizards undertake the
general control of Nature. They cause rain or drought,
determine the rising of the sun and, for this purpose, may go
every morning to a hill-top to summon him. An Australian
wizard claimed to have driven away a comet by means of
his sacred stones.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The adept procures a favourable wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
for his friends, or for his enemies an adverse; prospers the
crops or blights them; controls the game of the hunter, and
the cattle of the herdsman. The height of such claims may
be read in Medea’s boast in the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>In his own person the wizard may have the power of shape-changing
into some animal, or into any animal. He can fly
through the air to skyland to visit Daramulun; or to help dull
imaginations, he throws up a rope and climbs up by it, or
throws up a thread (like a spider’s) and climbs up by that.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
Or he may fly to the moon to be the guest of the man whom
we see there;<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> or to the region of death to visit Erlik Khan.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
By daylight he only flies in the spirit, during a trance; but
when it is quite dark he can go bodily. And probably this
points to the origin of such beliefs: for to dream that one
flies is not uncommon; and as in dreams we visit distant
places, and on waking seem suddenly to have returned by no
known means, the analogy of flight offers the easiest explanation
of such experiences. To fly is one of the most ancient
and persistent exploits of the profession: European witches
flew upon broomsticks (degenerate from Siberian horse-staves);
Dr. Faustus upon his magical cloak; and “levitation”
has been exhibited by recent “mediums.”</p>

<p>Wizards cause and cure love and other forms of sickness;
slay, or recall the soul to its accustomed habitation; sometimes
the same man kills and cures; sometimes he works only
evil, or only against evil; the Black and the White Magicians
may become well-recognised hostile sects. Wizards discover
thieves and murderers, or sell a fetich by whose power an
evil-doer walks invisible, if he takes care not to be seen.
They administer the ordeal and have in their power the life
of every one who undergoes it. They interpret dreams, and
prophesy by the flight of birds, the fall of dice, the making
of shoulder-blades and the aspect of the stars.</p>

<p>The sorcerer communicates with the ghosts of the dead
or with the spirits of nature and, by their aid, accomplishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
whatever can be done by Magic. He is possessed by them,
and operates or speaks by their power or inspiration; he
drives them out of others whom they possess, or sends them
on errands, controlling them either by the help of stronger
spirits or by his profound knowledge of enchantments.
Many of these things he is believed to do best during fits or
ecstasy; which he produces in himself by rhythmic drumming
and dancing, or by drugs, or by voluntary control of
a disciplined temperament, to the astonishment and conviction
of all beholders.</p>

<p>Such are the wizard’s pretensions, so well known that a
brief recital of them suffices; and whilst they seem to us too
absurd for any one to believe, least of all the wizard himself,
yet observers assure us that he often does believe in them,
and they are certainly taken to be genuine by the majority
of his tribesmen. For them his performances are so wonderful
as to put to shame the achievements of scientific invention;
and probably this partly explains the frequent reports that
savages are deficient in wonder. “It takes a good deal to
astonish a savage,” say Spencer and Gillen; “he is brought
up on Magic, and things that strike us with astonishment
he regards as simply the exhibition of Magic more powerful
than any possessed by himself.”<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Still the blacks were
astonished by the phonograph. Similarly we are told by
Stefánson<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> that things unusual but of an understood kind—a
bow that shoots fifty yards further than any other—may
excite endless marvelling amongst the Esquimo; but what
seems miraculous—a rifle-shot, or a binocular—is compared
with the supposed powers of the shaman, who can kill an
animal on the other side of a mountain, or see things that
are to happen to-morrow. Our surgery, too, is very inferior
to the shaman’s, who can take out a diseased heart or
vertebral column and replace it with a sound one.</p>


<h3><a id="ch08_03"></a>§ 3. Characteristics of the Wizard</h3>

<p>(1) Observers generally agree that the wizard, or medicine-man,
is distinguished in his tribe for intelligence and penetration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
or at least for cunning. He is apt to impress an unsympathetic
witness as “some fellow with more brains and less
industry than his fellows.” The wizard amongst the Fuegians,
says Fitzroy, is the most cunning and deceitful of his tribe,
and has great influence over his companions.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Amongst the
Bakongo, the witch-doctors, according to Mr. Weeks, have
sharp eyes, acute knowledge of human nature, and tact.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
The Samoyed shamans “are, as a rule, the most intelligent
and cunning of the whole race.”<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Cunning is plainly necessary
to the wizard’s life, and, for some of his functions, much
more than cunning. In many tribes his advice is asked
in every difficulty and upon every undertaking. Sir E. im
Thurn reports that the <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">peaiman</i> of the Arawaks learns and
hands down the traditions of his tribe and is the depository
of its medical and hunting lore.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> The surgical skill of Cherokee
medicine-men in the treatment of wounds was considerable.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
Still greater seems to have been that of the Fijians, with no
mean knowledge of anatomy learnt during their incessant
wars.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Medicine-men of the Amerinds discovered the virtues
of coca, jalap, sarsaparilla, chinchona, and guiacum,<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> implying
on their part superior curiosity and observation. The Bantu
doctors of S. Africa employ aloes, nux vomica, castor-oil,
fern, rhubarb and other drugs.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Livingstone says<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> that the
doctors, who inherit their profession, have “valuable knowledge,
the result of long and close observation,” and that they
thankfully learnt from him—when their patients were not
present. In all parts of the world some knowledge of drugs
and of certain methods of treatment, such as sweat-baths
and massage, ligatures, cauterisation and fomentation, seems
to have been possessed by the magical profession. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
weather-doctors and crop-guardians, they laid out the first
rudiments of astronomy and meteorology. All their knowledge
of this sort is, of course, no Magic, but experience and
common sense; though science is not derived from Magic,
the scientist does descend from the magician: not, however,
in so far as the magician operates by Magic, but in so far as
he operates by common sense. Among the Lushai tribes
the name for sorcerer, <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">puithiam</i>, means “great knower,”<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> the
equivalent of our “wizard.” But sorcery degrades the magic
art of medicine by discouraging with its theory of “possession”
every impulse of rational curiosity, and by substituting
for empirical treatment (however crude) its rites of exorcism
and propitiation.</p>

<p>In parts of the world so widely separated as Siberia, Greenland,
the remote back-woods of Brazil and S. Africa, wizards
have discovered the secret of ventriloquism. Everywhere
they have learned the art of conjuring, without which (especially
the trick of “palming”) many of their performances,
and notably the sucking-cure, could not be accomplished.
Their practice is generally clumsy and easily detected by
sophisticated whites, but imposes upon their patients and the
native bystanders.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> In India it is carried to a much higher
degree of illusion. Wizards often have a practical knowledge
of some obscure regions of psychology; such as the force of
suggestion and various means of conveying it, and the effect
of continuous rhythmic movements and noises in inducing
a state of exaltation or of dissociation.</p>

<p>A wizard’s tribesmen, of course, believe him to possess
knowledge absurdly in excess of the reality. He boasts of
it as the foundation of his power over nature or over spirits;
often as a supernatural gift of spirits whom he has visited,
or who have visited him, and who have initiated him; or
else as secret traditionary lore. It is by knowledge of human
nature that he rules his fellows; and he asserts that knowledge
of the names and origins of things and of spirits gives
him the same control over them. In Mr. Skeat’s <cite>Malay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Magic</cite>, incantations addressed by a miner to spirits or to
metals, adjuring the spirits to withdraw from his “claim,”
or the grains of metal to assemble there, contain the intimidating
and subduing verse:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I know the origin from which you sprang!”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">The same compelling power was employed—if we may trust
the <cite>Kalevala</cite>—by Finnish wizards; for “every thing or being
loses its ability for evil, as soon as some one is found who
knows, who proclaims its essence, its origin, its genealogy.”
“Tietaja, which etymologically signifies wise, or learned, is
ordinarily used for magician.”<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> It was by profound science
that mediæval magicians were believed to control demons;
and anybody celebrated for science was suspected of sorcery:
such as Grosseteste, Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon, Aquinas,
and Raymond Lulli; whose reputation supported the credit
of such men as Paracelsus and John Dee.</p>

<p>The fine arts in their rudiments owe much to the wizards.
Incantations in verse often reach a high pitch of lyric fervour.
The words <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">rune</i>, <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">carmen</i>, <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">laulaa</i> bear witness to the magic of
poetry. Virgil and Taliessin have been famous for more
than natural gifts; that one by superstitious repute, and
this by his own vaunting.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Dancing and pantomime were
cultivated for their magical virtues. Primitive carving and
painting are in many cases undertaken in order to influence
the spirits, or the animals, or the natural powers they
represent; and if Magic was the motive of the recently discovered
animal paintings dating from the old Stone Age,
its efficacy in encouraging art at that remote period rivalled
that of religious patronage in some later ages.</p>

<p>(2) In most tribes the wizard needs great force of will and
persistency of purpose—whether from deliberate choice or
from infatuation with the profession—to carry him through
the severe training that is often exacted from candidates
for the office; great audacity and courage to impel and sustain
him in the practice of his art, pestered by taboos and (the
sorcerer especially) always beset by supernatural terrors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
often by more real dangers; and unusual presence of mind
to extricate himself from very embarrassing situations. It
is true that, in some cases, where the office of wizard is
hereditary, or may be assumed by alleging the favour of
spirits, or some other underhand device—perhaps upon the
evidence of visions, or by mere fraud, or by a mixture of both—we
hear little of really serious initiatory rites; but often
these formalities are very painful or very expensive. Among
the Arunta, there are three classes of wizards: the first
and second, made by spirits, undergo no severe trial—except
the boring of a hole in their own tongues and the keeping of
it open, as evidence of a professional story about spirits who
slew them with spears, cut out their entrails and replaced them
with a new set and certain magic stones. But the third
class are initiated by two wizards of the first and second class,
who pretend to force crystal stones<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> into their bleeding bodies
from the front of the leg up to the breast bone, into the crown
of their heads and under the nail of the right forefinger.
This they must suffer in perfect silence, three times a day on
three consecutive days, with other tortures, followed by
various taboos; and, after all, they do not stand as well with
the tribe as those whom the spirits have initiated.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Can
there be any doubt that the initiatory rites of the third class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
represent the older magical custom, and that the fabulous
initiation by spirits is an overgrowth of Animism? There
are clear motives for the change; since the latter method is
easily carried out by oneself, is far less painful, and is more
stimulating to the imaginative belief of the laity, and therefore
more imposing. For the inverse change there are no
motives. And therefore, probably, wizards of the third class
are really less competent than the others; for the man
who, after the new spirit-path has been opened up, still
prefers the old road through pain and privation must be
(comparatively) an unimaginative, dull, honest, inferior
fellow.</p>

<p>Old wizards of the Warramunga, receiving a new candidate
for the profession, allow him during the process no rest;
he must stand or walk until quite worn out, when he scarcely
knows what is happening to him; deprived for a long time
of water and food, he becomes dazed and stupefied.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> In
the western islands of Torres Straits, a novice was taken into
the bush by his instructor, who defæcated into a shell full of
water and made him drink it with his eyes open; next he
must chew certain fruits and plants, which made his inside
bad and his skin itch; then shark’s flesh, and, finally, the
decomposing flesh of a dead man full of maggots. He became
very ill and half frantic. Few cared to undergo these rites;
some gave up the undertaking; some died of it.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> In British
Guiana, an aspirant to wizardry undergoes long fasts, wanders
alone in the bush (full of terrors to the timid Indian), and
accustoms himself to take large draughts of tobacco-juice
mixed with water, which cause temporary insanity.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Across
the watershed to the S.W., the office of medicine-man is
hereditary; yet Waterton reports that probationers have
to endure exhausting ordeals and tortures.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The severe
training of the Bantu witch-doctor kills many novices.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
Under such conditions, only men of unusual force of will, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
constancy of infatuation (qualities not always easy to discriminate),
can become wizards. Preparatory ritual for the
office of shaman among the Buryats of Siberia is elaborate,
expensive and intimidating: a candidate of poor family is
helped by the community to get animals for sacrifice and
objects necessary for the rites; but many shrink from the
trial, “dreading the vast responsibility it brings; for the
gods deal severely with those who have undergone consecration,
and punish with death any serious mistake.” There
are nine degrees in the profession, each requiring a special
initiation.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Thus, in many cases, the ordeal of initiation
turns away the weak and incompetent, and keeps up the
wizardly profession at a high level of resolution and endurance.
In more sophisticated societies a similar result is
obtained by the belief that the attainment of magical powers
depends upon the undergoing of prolonged austerity in
study, or in privations and tortures, which give a mystical
right to supernatural power: the superstition upon which
Southey raised <cite>The Curse of Kehama</cite>—least unreadable of
his romances.</p>

<p>As for the courage that may be requisite for carrying on
the wizard’s practices, when he is the terror of his neighbours,
their attitude towards him varies, in different tribes, from
the tamest toleration to murderous antagonism. Thus, in
the western islands of Torres Straits, Professor Haddon never
knew the sorcerers mobbed or violently put to death on
account of their magical practices.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> In New Caledonia,
when a sorcerer causes a general famine, the people merely
make him presents to procure a return of plenty.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Among
the Todas, a man who is the victim of a sorcerer pays
him to have the curse removed.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> In such cases, effrontery
is all the sorcerer needs. On the other hand, near
Finsch Harbour in New Guinea, a dangerous sorcerer is
often put to death; and so he is amongst the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Kais.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Such in fact is the more general practice;<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and the
wizard, carrying on his profession at the risk of his life,
must be supported by the sort of fearlessness that criminals
often show.</p>

<p>Confronted with supernatural dangers, the sorcerer’s need
of courage must depend upon the sincerity of his own belief
in them: a matter to be discussed in the fourth section of
this chapter. If his professions are veracious, the attitude
of such a man toward spiritual powers cannot be sustained
by any ordinary daring. In the N.W. Amazons the shaman
is the only one of his tribe who dares go alone into the haunted
forest. Zulu doctors, who specialise as “heaven-herds,”
fight the Thunderstorm with spear and shield until he flees
away.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Everywhere the sorcerer fights the demons of disease
with reckless valour. On the Congo he drives them into
some animal, and then cuts its head off. In North America
he intimidates, quells and exorcises them with furious boasting.
In Siberia, to capture the fleeting soul of a patient,
he follows it over land and sea and into the regions of the
dead. The Innuit of Greenland acknowledge Sedna as the
supreme Being and the creatress of all living things; yet
their angakoq subdue even her: one lures her from Adlivun
with a magic song; whilst another, as she emerges, harpoons
her with a seal-spear, which is then found to be smeared with
blood.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> To obtain assistance from even the highest spirits
the wizard deceives them; or to slay an enemy he usurps
their powers. The Malay avenges himself by making an
image of his victim in a shroud, and praying over it as over
the dead; then he buries it in the path to his victim’s house,
and says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">“Peace be to you, ho prophet Tap, in whose charge the earth is!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo I am burying the corpse of (name of victim)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am bidden by the prophet Mohammed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he (the victim) was a rebel against God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you assist in killing him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you do not kill him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall be a rebel against God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rebel against Mohammed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not I who am burying him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is Gabriel who is burying him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you grant my prayer this day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant it by the grace of my petition within the fold of the creed La ilaha, etc.”<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">One might suppose that the audacity of blaspheming could
rise no higher than this; but an Egyptian woman, when in
labour, was taught to declare herself to be Isis, and to
summon the gods to her help. “Should they refuse to
come, ‘Then shall ye be destroyed, ye nine gods; the heaven
shall no longer exist, the earth shall no longer exist, the five
days over and above the year shall cease to be; offerings
shall no more be made to the gods, the lords of Heliopolis,
etc.’”<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> If the facts were not before us, it would be incredible
that a fixed purpose of obtaining supernatural aid should
thus exclude from the mind all thoughts of the divine
attributes and of one’s own insignificance.</p>

<p>(3) What motives impel a man to adopt this strange and
hazardous profession, or sustain him amidst all the dangers
and disappointments of exercising it? In the first place,
some men are oppressed by a vocation toward wizardry;
just as amongst ourselves some men have an irresistible
vocation to be poets, though that way poverty stares them
in the face. To ordinary people these seem to be cases for
the asylum. Yet we may understand the “votary of the
Muses” by considering that the poet, as the master of rhythm,
the treasurer of tradition, the arbiter of fame, has had a
necessary place in the ancient culture of the tribes, and
greatest in the noblest tribes. A tribe that produces poets
has an advantage in the struggle of life; and, accordingly, a
strain of poet-blood is bred in the tribe, and shows itself in
a certain number of youths in each generation. I think the
same must be true of wizards. They are often “called”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the Altaians believe that no man of his free will becomes a
shaman.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Like poets, they are sacred and possessed. They
are also very useful: their functions in several ways overlap
those of the poet, as in cherishing traditions; and often
they themselves are poets. They give confidence to their
fellows amidst the awful imaginary dangers of savage life.
Their nervous temperament may raise the vital level of a
tribe. They keep alive the beliefs in taboo and the like
mysterious dangers, on which savage order and morality
depend; and in many cases they become leaders and chieftains.
In this way, belief in Magic and Animism seems to
have been the necessary scaffolding of social life.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> And were
this all, the utility of wizards would be clear. But they often
do so much and such horrible mischief, prohibiting every
improvement and spreading general terror, that it is difficult
to judge, in such cases, whether their activities leave a balance
of good or of evil. Perhaps sometimes the evil may exceed,
and a tribe may degenerate and perish of it. On the whole,
however, there is certainly a balance of good, especially by
leadership at early stages of social development; and this
accounts for the flourishing from age to age of the wizardly
profession, and for the attraction it has for those of wizardly
blood who enter it, because it promises to satisfy an innate
disposition. Even in a civilised country, this disposition
still, in a few people, manifests itself in the old way; but
for the most part has been “sublimated” into other professions.
Of course that which attracts the neophyte of
wizardry is not the utility of the profession, any more than
the youthful poet is allured by the utility of poetry. That
which appeals to the wizard of inbred genius is (besides the
indulgence of his personal powers) the mystery of wizardry;
which excites in his soul a complex, consisting chiefly of
curiosity as to the unknown powers that control nature and
spirit, the fascination of fear in approaching them and an
exaltation of self-consciousness at the prospect of attaining
superhuman wisdom and authority. The article on Shamanism,<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
which I have cited so often, describes the shaman as
sometimes profoundly convinced that he was chosen for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
service of the spirits; and says that some feel a compulsive
vocation, and endure persecution for their faith; they
cannot help shamanising. One is mentioned as having been
gifted with a sensitive nature and an ardent imagination,
he had a strong belief in the spirits and in his own mysterious
intercourse with them.</p>

<p>Men of such a temperament, I take it, distinguishing
themselves above others when every man practised magic
or sorcery, founded the profession, and are always its vital
nucleus, though in time they may become but a small proportion
of its members. Under sincere infatuation they
established its observances—the fastings, sufferings, austerities,
visions and frenzies of initiation, whether into magical
knowledge or spiritual possession; the working of themselves
up, whilst officiating, into the orgiastic intoxication in which
they felt their own greatness and dominated their audience;
and they discovered some of the modes of operating by drugs
and suggestion and some real remedies. But the profession,
once formed, soon had attractions for a very different sort
of man, impelled by very different motives; who saw in
it the road sometimes to wealth, always to reputation and
power. Since, amongst very primitive people there is little
wealth to collect, and sometimes (as we have seen) remuneration
of magical services is neither given nor expected, the
earlier of these motives must have been the love of causing
wonder and fear, of the power which their fellows’ fears
conferred and of the reputation which consequently spread
far and wide. In Mota (Melanesia) a man in control of
magical virtue will render services without reward, merely
to add to his reputation for the possession of <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">mana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> At
first they seem to have had no privileges, but power acquires
privilege: so that, among the Warramunga, wizards are free
from sexual taboos;<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> in Guiana no tribesman dares refuse
the sorcerer anything, not even his wife;<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> among the Boloki,
the sorcerer is never charged with injurious witchcraft and,
therefore, is never in danger of the ordeal.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, the wizard may not be respected in
private life, but only in the exercise of his office. Fear and
wonder, in fact, do not always entirely blind the eyes of
neighbours to his shortcomings. Spencer and Gillen tell us
that the Magic of distant places, being the less known, is the
more feared.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The Rev. J.&nbsp;H. Weeks even says that on the
Congo the village medicine-man is seldom engaged at home;
for the people know that his fetich cannot protect him or
his from harm and, therefore, hire some one from another
village of whom they know less.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Similarly, a tribe is apt to
fear its own adepts less than those of another tribe of lower
culture, whose ways are less known and more mysterious:
as Malays fear especially the Jakuns;<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> formerly the Swedes
the Finns, and the Finns the Lapps; the Todas the Kurumba;<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
and in Macedonia Mohammedan monks enjoy a far higher
reputation for Magic than the Christian.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Still, the wizard, whether of home or foreign growth,
becomes necessary in every crisis of life, at birth and marriage,
in misfortune, sickness and death; in every undertaking—hunting,
agriculture or commerce; and by his omens and
auguries may determine war and peace. After his own death,
he may sometimes look forward to being deified. With such
powers, surrounded by intimidated and dependent crowds,
and often enjoying a long career of conscious or unconscious
imposture, he seems to himself, as to others, a “superman”;
his <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Selbstgefühl</i> rises to megalomania, and his boasting becomes
monstrous and stupefying.</p>

<p>(4) The more to impress the imagination of all spectators
and enhance his reputation, the wizard usually affects a
costume, or behaviour, or strange companionship of animals,
that distinguishes him from the rest of his tribe. Not always;
for Miss Czaplicka<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> says that in Siberia the shaman is in
everyday life not distinguished from others, except occasionally
by a haughty demeanour; but the rule is otherwise.
A.&nbsp;W. Howitt<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> relates that one Australian medicine-man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
obtained influence by always carrying about with him a
lace-lizard four feet long; another cherished a tame brown
snake; and an old woman kept a native cat (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Daysurus</i>):
“familiars” that correspond to the black cats and goats of
our own witches. The Arunta medicine-man bores a hole
in his tongue, appears with a broad band of powdered charcoal
and fat across the bridge of his nose and learns to look preternaturally
solemn, as one possessing knowledge hidden
from ordinary men.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> In the forest of the upper Amazons,
the medicine-man does not depilate, though the rest of his
tribe do so to distinguish themselves from monkeys; and
he attempts to present in his costume something original
and striking.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> In S. Africa, too, the witch-doctor’s dress is
often very conspicuous. So it is throughout history: the
thaumaturgist, by his wand, robes, austerities, demeanour,
advertises himself as a man apart from the crowd. Rites of
initiation mark this superiority: as tribal initiation separates
a man from women and boys, so the wizard’s initiation makes
him a “superman.”</p>

<p>(5) Such a temper cannot endure opposition, and is jealous
of rivalry; the man whom it actuates lives in constant fear
of failure and discredit and is, therefore, full of suspicion
and cruelty. In S. Africa, professional hatred is pushed to
its last limits amongst magicians. They test their colleagues,
steal each other’s drugs, or pray to the gods to make their
rival’s art inefficient.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The savage sorcerer looks with no
kindly eye upon the European; who, too plainly, possesses
extraordinary Magic. Captain Whiffen says<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> of the sorcerer
amongst the South Amerinds, who has much knowledge of
poisons, that to maintain his reputation, if he has declared
that he cannot cure a patient, he poisons him. Of the sorcerer
of the Lower Congo, Mr. Weeks says, that “his face becomes
ugly, repulsive, the canvas on which cruelty, chicanery, hatred
and all devilish passions are portrayed with repellent
accuracy.”<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> An extreme case perhaps; but, leading up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
it, there are all degrees of rancour and malignity toward
those who hinder our ambitions; and it can only be in
exceptional magicians that megalomania is reconcilable with
considerateness and magnanimity.</p>

<p>(6) Since the greater part of the wizard’s practice is
imposture (whether he believes in himself or not), he must be
an actor; and his success must greatly depend on the degree
in which he possesses the actor’s special gifts and temperament:
an audience must be a stimulus to him and not a
check; he exhibits himself not unwillingly. To the shaman,
Miss Czaplicka tells us,<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> an audience is useful: though the
presence of an European is depressing. A Chuckchee
shaman without a sort of chorus considers himself unable to
discharge his office: novices in training usually get a brother
or sister to respond to their exercises. And, indeed, a
wizard’s exhibitions often provide without design the same
sort of social entertainment as those of an actor. One
cannot read of the shaman’s performance of a pantomimic
journey on horseback to the South, over frozen mountains,
burning deserts, and along the bridge of a single hair, stretched
across a chasm over foaming whirlpools, to Erlik Khan’s
abode, and then home again on the back of a flying goose,
without perceiving that in the wilds of Siberia such an
entertainment, whatever other virtues it may have, supplies
the want of theatres and music-halls, and that in such displays
a dramatic profession might originate.</p>

<p>But there are two kinds of actors; and they correspond
well enough with the two kinds of wizards already described—the
vocational and the exploitative. Some actors are said
to identify themselves with their assumed character and
situation so profoundly as to substantiate the fiction: concentration
of imagination, amounting to dissociation, makes
the part they play, whilst it lasts, more real than anything
else; and raises them, for that time, in energy of thought,
feeling and action, much above their ordinary powers; so
that they compel the attention, sympathy and belief of the
audience. But others study their part and determine beforehand
exactly what tones, gestures, expressions are the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
effective reinforcement of every word, and thereafter carry
out upon the stage in cold blood the whole dramatic lesson
which they have taught themselves. Perhaps more common
than either of these extreme types is the actor who begins
by studying under a sort of inspiration, and after experimenting
for a few nights, repeats what he has found to
answer best. We need not consider those who can do
nothing but what they have been taught by others. Well,
the wizard by vocation probably behaves like the first kind
of actor: enters upon any office to which he may be called
in exclusive devotion to his task; works himself into a
frenzy, groans, writhes and sweats under the possession of
his demon; chants incantations in an archaic tongue; drums
and dances by the hour, and falls into speechless trance—according
to the professional pattern—all in what may be
described as dramatic good faith. By native disposition and
by practised self-suggestion he obtains a temporary dissociation.
The opposite sort of wizard, exploiting the profession,
sees all this, and imitates it with such improvements as he
may be able to devise. Of the intervening crowd of charlatans,
who mingle self-delusion with deceit in all possible
proportions, no definite account can be given.</p>

<p>According to Diderot,<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> the greatest actors belong to the
second class, to the deliberate and disciplined artists. We
may be sure the gods in the gallery, if they understood what
was going on under their eyes, would always prefer the inspired
performers. Probably these are, in fact, the greatest
in their best hours, but less to be depended on, less sure of
being always equal to themselves. And the same may be
true of the corresponding sorts of wizards. The lucid impostor,
at any rate, is less likely to be abashed by unforeseen
difficulties and by the awkwardness of failure, less likely to
be mobbed and murdered and pegged down in his grave with
aspen stakes.</p>

<p>(7) Wizards are very often people who manifest an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
hysterical or epileptoid diathesis; and candidates for the
profession who show signs of it are often preferred by the
doctors. According to Miss Czaplicka, hysteria (common in
Siberia) is at the bottom of the shaman’s vocation: but it is
not merely a matter of climate; for the Rev. E.&nbsp;T. Bryant
writes of the Zulus—“the great majority of diviners being
clearly of neurotic type”;<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> and on all sides we obtain from
descriptions of wizards the same impression. The word
“shaman” comes not, as usually supposed, from the Sanskrit
(<i lang="und" xml:lang="und">śramana</i> = work, a religious mendicant), but from
<i lang="und" xml:lang="und">saman</i>, which is Manchu for “one who is excited, moved,
raised.”<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> The effect on the audience of shamanising depends
in great measure upon the fits, ecstasy, convulsions introduced
at some stage of the performance and attributed to possession
by the spirits. Similar exhibitions have been reported by
all observers of wizardry. Professor Otto Stoll of Zurich has
described<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> the phenomena as they occur in all countries and
all ages; and he attributes them, as well as hallucinations
and analgesia (as in the fire-walk), which wizards also have
at command, to the power of self-suggestion acquired by
practice and training, on the basis (of course) of a natural
disposition. Cagliostro declared that he could smell atheists
and blasphemers; “the vapour from such throws him into
epileptic fits; into which sacred disorder he, like a true
juggler, has the art of falling when he likes.”<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The wizard’s
fits are voluntarily induced; but from the moment the attack
takes place the development of its symptoms becomes
automatic. Between the fits, however, says Miss Czaplicka,
he must be able to master himself, or else he becomes incapable
of his profession: nervous and excitable often to the verge
of insanity, if he passes that verge he must retire.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> In short,
his ecstasy is the climacterical scene of his dramatic performance,
the whole of which must be rendered with the disciplined
accuracy of an artist. We are not to think of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
shaman as an hysterical patient: if he were, there would
be greater, not less, reason to suspect him of deceit. No
doubt the training which gives control of the nervous attack
protects the subject from its unwholesome consequences;
there seems to be no special liability to disease or to a shortening
of life. Formerly in Siberia, before the power of the
profession was broken by immigrant beliefs and practices,
it was necessary that the shaman should be well-developed
mentally and physically (as has often been required of
priests); and such a constitution is by no means incompatible
with an intense histrionic temperament.</p>

<p>A necessary complement to the suggestive devices of a
wizard is the suggestibility of his clients. There is such a
thing as an assenting or a dissenting disposition—suggestibility
or contrasuggestibility; but the latter is, like the
former, a tendency to react without reflection, and may be
as well controlled by appropriate suggestions. The power of
any given suggestion to control the course of a man’s thought
and action depends upon the resistance (apart from contra-suggestibility)
which it meets with in his mind; and this
depends upon the extent, quality and integration of his
apperceptive masses, and upon the facility with which they
come into action. Upon the perceptual plane a savage’s
mind is well organised, and accordingly his suggestibility is
low; but upon the ideational plane it is in most cases ill
organised, poor in analysis, classification, generalisation,
poor in knowledge, abounding in imagination-beliefs about
Magic and Animism; so that, except in natural sceptics
(who, as we shall see, exist among savages), the suggestions
of the wizard meet with little resistance from common sense
and with ready acceptance by magical and animistic prejudice.
But even with a man of common sense, a suggestion,
however absurd, may for a time prevail, if his mental reaction
is slow; although, with time for reflection, he will certainly
reject it. The art of the wizard consists in getting such
hold of his client’s attention that, as in hypnosis, the power
of reflective comparison is suspended and criticism abolished.
There are many masters of this art. The client’s state of
mind is very common in the effects of oratory, the theatre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
ghost-stories and generally in the propagation of opinion,
suspicion and prejudice.</p>


<h3><a id="ch08_04"></a>§ 4. The Wizard and the Sceptic</h3>

<p>Inasmuch as the wizard’s boasting, conjuring, ventriloquising,
dramatising and practising of all the arts of suggestion,
seem incompatible with sincerity, whilst nevertheless he is
devoted to his calling, some observers have declared him a
calculating impostor, whilst others maintain that he, in
various degrees, believes in himself and shares the delusions
which he propagates. Examples may be found in support of
either position.</p>

<p>Some say that the wizard believes in himself because all
others believe in him; that at a certain level of culture,
there is an universal social obsession by certain ideas, from
which the individual cannot escape, and for whose consequences,
therefore, he is not responsible. According to
this theory, a sort of tribal insanity prevails. Dr. Mercier
says that, in the individual, paranoia is characterised by
systematised delusion: “there is an organised body of (false)
knowledge, and it differs from other delusions in the fact that
it colours the whole life of the patient; it regulates his daily
conduct; it provides him with an explanation of all his
experiences; it is his theory of the cosmos.” And, again,
“as long as the highest level of thought is intact, so that we
can and do recognise that our mistakes are mistakes and our
disorders, whether of mind or conduct, are disorders, so long
sanity is unaffected, and our mistakes and disorders are sane.
As soon, however, as we become incompetent to make this
adjustment ... insanity is established.”<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> These passages
exactly describe the condition of a wizard and his tribe
afflicted with social paranoia: their theories of Magic and
Animism and of the wizard’s relations with invisible powers,
may truly be said to form an organised body of (false) knowledge,
to colour all their lives, to explain everything that
happens to them; and their mistakes and disorders to be
incorrigible by reflection or experience. Such conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the social mind have, I believe, existed (and may still exist),
tending toward, and sometimes ending in, a tribe’s destruction.
That, in such a case, there should be unanimity is not
necessary; it is enough that the current of belief, in certain
directions, be overwhelming. But such extreme cases are
rare. Normally there may be found, even in backward
tribes, a good deal of incredulity and of what may be called
primitive rationalism or positivism.</p>

<p>Considerable sections of a tribe sometimes co-operate in
imposture, the men against the women and children, or the
old against the young; and it cannot be supposed that,
where this occurs, anything like universal delusion prevails.
The Arunta, who teach their women and children that
Twanyiriki is a spirit living in wild regions, who attends
initiations, and that the noise of the bull-roarer is his voice;
whilst they reveal to the youths when initiated that the
bundle of churinga is the true Twanyiriki,<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> cannot be blind
to the existence of social fictions. The discovery by initiated
youths in some parts of New Guinea, that Balum, the monster
that is believed to swallow them during initiation, is nothing
but a bug-a-boo, and that his growl is only the bull-roarer,
must be a shock to their credulity.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Indeed, disillusionment
as to some popular superstition is a common characteristic
of initiation ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> On the mainland of New Caledonia,
a spirit-night is held every five months; when the people
assemble around a cave and call upon the ghosts, supposed
to be inside it, to sing; and they do sing—the nasal squeak
of old men and women predominating.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> There is not in such
cases any natural growth of social delusion, subduing the
individual mind, but prearranged cozenage; and a wizard
with such surroundings, instead of being confirmed in the
genuineness of his art, only reads there the method of his own
imposture in large type.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Home-bred wizards, who are less trusted than those who
live further off, or than those of an inferior tribe, do not
derive self-confidence from the unanimous approval of their
neighbours.</p>

<p>Again, the general prevalence of delusions in a tribe does
not suppress the scepticism of individuals. It is reasonable
to expect such scepticism to be most prevalent amongst
men of rank, who are comparatively exempt from the oppression
of popular sanctions; and probably this is the fact.
Such exemption, by preserving a nucleus of relatively sane
people, is one of the great social utilities of rank. The
Basuto chief, Mokatchané, surrounded by people grossly
superstitious, lent himself to their practices; but in paying
his diviners he did not hesitate so say “that he regarded
them as the biggest impostors in the world.”<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> In Fiji, it
is doubtful whether the high chiefs believed in the inspiration
of the priests, though it suited their policy to appear to
do so. There was an understanding between the two orders:
one got sacrifices (food), the other good oracles. A chieftain,
on receiving an unfavourable oracle, said to the priest:
“Who are you? Who is your god? If you make a stir, I
will eat you”<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>—not metaphorically. In Tonga, “even
seventeen years before the arrival of the first missionaries,
the chiefs did not care to conceal their scepticism.” In
Vavou, Taufaahan, having long been sceptical of his ancestral
faith, on learning of Christianity, hanged five idols by the
neck, beat the priestess, and burned the spirit-houses.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> The
Vikings, like the Homeric heroes, are said to have fought their
gods; and at other times to have declared entire disbelief
in them. Hence the easy conversion of the North to Christianity.
Scepticism may have been fashionable at court
much earlier: “It is scarcely possible to doubt,” says Mr.
Chadwick, “that familiarity, not to say levity, in the treatment
of the gods characterised the Heroic Age [Teutonic—<span class="f8">A.D.</span>
350-550] just as much as that of the Vikings.”<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
burlesque representations of the gods in some passages of the
<cite>Iliad</cite> are a sort of atheism: in astonishing contrast with
the sublime piety elsewhere expressed. And the inadequacy
of such a literary religion (like that of Valhalla) may explain
the facile reception (or revival) of the Mysteries in the sixth
century <span class="f8">B.C.</span> History abounds with examples of rulers and
priests who, in collusion, have used religion for political
convenience, in a way that implied their own disbelief and
opened unintentionally the doors of disbelief to others.</p>

<p>But it is not only chiefs and heroes whose minds are sometimes
emancipated from popular superstitions. An old
Australian whose duty it was to watch the bones of a dead man
and to keep alight a fire near them, sold them for some
tobacco and a tomahawk, in great fear lest it should be known
to his tribesmen; but he “evidently suffered from no qualms
of conscience”:<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> that is to say, he feared the living, but
not the dead. W. Stanbridge says of the aborigines of
Victoria that “there are doctors or priests of several vocations;
of the rain, of rivers and of human diseases ... but
there are natives who refuse to become doctors and disbelieve
altogether the pretensions of those persons.”<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> John Matthew
writes of the tribe with which he was best acquainted—“whilst
the blacks had a term for ghosts and behind these
were departed spirits, ... individual men would tell you
upon inquiry that they believed that death was the last of

Disbelief is expressed in actions more emphatically than in
words; the plundering of tombs has been universal. An
idol-maker of Maeva assured Ellis that, “although at times
he thought it was all deception and only practised his trade
for gain, yet at other times he really thought the gods he
himself had made were powerful beings.”<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> In Tonga it

hardly believe that men continue to exist after death; for

inquire further—“why do the dead become visible
only in dreams?” etc.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> A Tanghul told me, says Mr. T.&nbsp;C.

<p>Of such examples of the occurrence of “free-thought” in
all parts of the world, no doubt, a little investigation would
discover many more. Everywhere some savages think for
themselves; though, like civilised folk, they cannot always
venture to avow their conclusions. We must not suppose
that belief is as uniform as custom or conventional doctrine:
custom and convention hinder thought in dull people, but
do not enslave it in the “keener intelligence.” Without the
enviable advantage of personal intimacy with savages, I
have, by reading about them, gained the impression that they
enjoy a considerable measure of individuality—as much as
the less educated Europeans—and are not mere creatures of a
social environment.</p>

<p>The most backward savages have a large stock of common
sense concerning the properties of bodies, of wind and water
and fire, of plants and animals and human nature; for this
is the necessary ground of their life. This common sense
has certain characters which are in conflict with their superstitions;
the facts known to common sense are regular, proportional,
the same for all; not often failing and needing
excuses, not extravagant and disconnected, not depending on
the presence of some fantastic mountebank. Savages do
not draw explicitly the comparisons that make this conflict
apparent; but it may be felt without being defined. Some
of them, especially, are (as amongst ourselves) naturally
inclined to a positive way of thinking; their common sense
predominates over the suggestions of Magic and Animism,
and they, more than others aware of the conflict, become
the proto-sceptics or rationalists. Lecky observes that
beliefs and changes of belief depend not upon definite arguments,
but upon habits of thought. In the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
century a new habit of thought overcame the belief in witchcraft
and miracles;<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> and in many other centuries it has
everywhere done the same for those in whom the “apperceptive
mass” of common sense became more or less clearly
and steadily a standard of belief, repelling the apperceptive
masses of Magic and Animism with all their contents and
alliances. They had more definite ideas than others, little
love of the marvellous, little subjection to fear, desire,
imagination.</p>

<p>Sometimes the dictates of common sense are imposed by
necessity. The Motu (Papuasian) were accustomed to rub
spears with ginger to make them fly straight. It had, however,
been discovered that no amount of Magic would turn
a poor spearman into an accurate thrower.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Spear-throwing
is too serious a concern not to be judged of upon its merits,
however interesting the properties of ginger. A whole
tribe may in some vital matter, whilst practising a superstitious
rite, disregard its significance: like the Kalims, who
hold a crop-festival in January, and afterwards take the
omens as to what ground shall be cultivated for next harvest;
“but this seems a relic of old times, for the circle of cultivation
is never broken, let the omens be what they may.”<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
That is a tacit triumph of common sense.</p>

<p>The bearing of all this on the character of the wizard is
as follows: since everywhere sceptics occur, and some individuals
go further than others in openly or secretly rejecting
superstitions, why should not the wizard or sorcerer, who is
amongst the most intelligent and daring of his tribe, be himself
a rationalist and, therefore, a conscious impostor? That
much of his art is imposture no one disputes; and so far as
it is so, he sees it as part of the ordinary course of experience.
The sorcerer on the Congo who drove a spirit into the
dark corner of a hut, stabbed it there, and showed the blood
upon his spear, having produced the blood (as his son confessed
to Mr. Weeks) by scratching his own gums, was by
that action himself instructed in common sense.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> He saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
in it quite plainly an ordinary course of events, the “routine
of experience”; whilst the spectators were mystified. Must
he not, then, have more common sense than other people?</p>

<p>In fact, he recognises the course of nature and his own
impotence, whenever an attempt to conjure would endanger
his reputation. The Arunta medicine-men exhibit great
dramatic action in curing various diseases; but waste no
antics on recognisable senile decay.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> The medicine-man of
Torres Straits admits that he cannot make a “big wind”
from the south-east during the north-west season.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The
Polynesian sorcerers confessed their practices harmless to
Europeans;<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>—who were not suggestible on that plane of
ideas. Shamans amongst the Yakuts would not try to cure
diarrhœa, small-pox, syphilis, scrofula or leprosy, and would
not shamanise in a house where small-pox had been.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> These
miracle-mongers sometimes know a hawk from a handsaw.
It seems reasonable, then, to assume that wizards have more
common sense than other people; since, besides the instruction
of common experience, they know in their professional
practice (at least in a superficial way) the real course of
events, which is concealed from the laity. And, no doubt,
of those whose art is deliberate imposture, this is true. But
the infatuation of those who are wizards by vocation may be
incorrigible by any kind of evidence: especially as to the
genuineness of another’s performance. Dr. Rivers speaks of
the blindness of the man of rude culture to deceitful proceedings
on the part of others with which he is familiar in his own
actions.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> For the wizard there are established prejudices,
professional and personal interest, fear of trusting his own
judgment, supernatural responsibility, desire of superhuman
power, sometimes even a passionate desire to alleviate the
sufferings of his tribesmen, and everything else that confirms
the will to believe.</p>

<h3><a id="ch08_05"></a>§ 5. The Wizard’s Persuasion</h3>

<p>Many practices of wizards involve a representation of the
course of events as something very different from the reality;
and there is no doubt that frequently, or even in most cases,
wizards are aware of this, as in performing the sucking cure or
visiting the man in the moon. But some anthropologists
dislike to hear such practices described as “fraud,” “imposture”
or “deceit”; and for certain classes of wizards it
seems (as I shall show) unjust to speak in these terms of their
profession. Still, taking the profession and its actions on
the whole, it is difficult to find in popular language terms more
fairly descriptive. We meet here the inconvenience that other
social or moral sciences find when they try to use common
words in a specially restricted sense. In Economics, <abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>,
“rent,” “wages,” “profits” have definite meanings very
different from their popular acceptance. In Ethics, what
controversy, what confusion in the defining of “virtue” and
“the good”! In Metaphysics, what is the meaning of
“cause”; what is the meaning of “intuition”? The terms
must be defined in each system. If then, in these pages,
the conduct of a man who, on his way to cure a sufferer of
“stitch in the side,” conceals in his mouth a piece of bone
or pebble, and after dancing, and sucking hard enough at
the patient’s belly, produces that bone or pebble as the cause
of pain—is described as “fraud,” or “imposture,” or “deceit,”
the words are used to describe the fact only, without any such
imputation upon the man’s character as they convey in
popular usage. Scientifically considered, the man and his
circumstances being such as they are, his actions are a
necessary consequence; in this limited region of thought
moral censure is irrelevant.</p>

<p>There are some wizards, as it were in minor orders, such
as Professor Seligman calls “departmental experts,” especially
the man who blesses gardens, so earnest and harmless
that no one will abuse them. They visit the garden at the
owner’s request, practise a little hocus-pocus, mutter a few
spells, take a small fee and go peaceably home. The owner
indeed supposes himself to buy fertility, and obtains only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
peace of mind—a greater good say the moralists. The
wizard has done what he learnt of his father, what respectable
neighbours approve of; there is always some crop to justify
his ministry, and many an evil power to excuse occasional
blight or drought. If he is convinced of being a really
indispensable man, it is easily intelligible.</p>

<p>As to the profession in general, a small number of wizards—wizards
by vocation—may be strongly persuaded of the
genuineness of the art; a much larger body mingles credulity
in various proportions with fraud; and not a few are deliberate
cheats. Some of the greatest masters of wizardry are
dissatisfied with their own colleagues: that eminent shaman
Scratching Woman said to Bogoras the traveller, “There are
many liars in our calling.”<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> On the other hand, the wizard
who demonstrated the “pointing-stick” to Messrs. Spencer
and Gillen, and having no object upon which to discharge
its Magic, thought it had entered his own head and thereupon
fell ill, was certainly a believer;<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> and so was the wizard who
felt that he had lost his power after drinking a cup of tea,
because hot drinks were taboo to him.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Now a cheat needs no
explanation—at least no more on the Yenisei than on the
Thames; and the variety of those who mingle credulity with
fraud is too great to be dealt with. What chiefly needs to be
accounted for is the persuasion of those who—in spite of so
many circumstances that seem to make disillusion inevitable—are
in some manner true believers—in the manner, that is
to say, of imaginative belief, founded on tradition and desire,
unlike the perceptual belief of common sense.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Men under a vocation to wizardry, of course, begin with
full belief in it. Probably they are possessed by the imaginative
and histrionic temperament, which we have seen to be
favourable to eminence as a wizard. Their vocation consists
in the warm sympathy and emulation with which, before their
own initiation, they witness the feats of great practitioners,
and which generally imply a stirring of their own latent
powers; just as many an actor has begun by being “stage-struck.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
A man of such temperament is prone to self-delusion
not only as to his own powers, but in other ways.
The wizard often begins by fasting and having visions;
thereby weakening his apprehension of the difference between
fact and phantasy. The fixed idea of his calling begets in
his imagination a story of what happened at his initiation,
manifestly false, but not a falsehood—a “rationalisation”
according to wizardly ideas of what he can remember of that
time. If initiated with torture, which he endures for the sake
of his vocation, he is confirmed in it. When called upon to
perform, he “works himself up” by music, dancing and whatever
arts he may have learned or discovered, into a state of
dissociation, during which his judgment of everything
extraneous to his task is suspended; and his dramatic
demeanour uninhibited by fear or shame, unembarrassed by
any second thoughts, makes, by vivid gestures and contortions
and thrilling tones, a profound impression upon patients,
clients and witnesses. His performances may derive some
original traits from his own genius; but must generally
conform to a traditionary pattern and to the consequent
expectations of the audience. By practice he acquires—as
for their own tasks all artists, poets and actors must—a
facility in inducing the state of dissociation (more or less
strict), in which work goes smoothly forward under the
exclusive dominance of a certain group of ideas and sentiments.
Whether, in this condition, he believes in himself
and his calling, or not, is a meaningless question. Whilst the
orgasm lasts there is no place for comparison or doubt.
And since he really produces by his frenzy or possession a great
effect upon the spectators—though not always the precise
effect of curing a patient or of controlling the weather at
which he aimed—we need not wonder if he believes himself
capable of much more than he ever accomplishes. The
temperament, most favourable to a wizard’s success is not
likely to be accompanied by a disposition to the positive or
sceptical attitude of mind. Moreover, to the enthusiast
for whom belief is necessary, it is also necessary to create
the evidence. That the end justifies the means is not his
explicit maxim, but a matter of course. Gibbon comments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
on “the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy, which
may be observed, or at least suspected, in the characters of
the most conscientious fanatics.”<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> After failures, indeed,
or in the languor that follows his transports, there may come
many chilling reflections; only, however, to be dispersed
by an invincible desire to believe in his own powers and in
the profession to which he is committed.</p>

<p>The “white” wizard may pacify a troubled conscience by
reflecting that at any rate he discharges a useful social
function; as, in fact, he does, so far as he relieves the fears of
his tribesmen and gives them confidence. To understand
the “black” wizard, we must turn to the dark side of human
nature. That a man should resort to magic or sorcery to
avenge himself or his kinsmen, or to gratify his carnality,
jealousy or ambition, is intelligible to everybody; but that
he should make a profession of assisting others for a fee to
betray, injure, or destroy those with whom he has no quarrel,
seems almost too unnatural to be credible. Yet it admits
of a very easy explanation. The love of injuring and slaying
is deeply rooted in us: men afflicted with homicidal neurosis
are known to the asylums and to the criminal courts of all
civilised nations; assassins on hire have often been notoriously
obtainable. To slay in cold blood by violence, or even by
poison, seems, however, less revolting than to slay by sorcery
and obscene rites. But the fascination of this employment
may be further understood by considering the attraction
that secret power and the proof of their own cunning has for
many people. To slay is sweet; but the ancient hunter
depended more upon strategy than upon the frontal attack;
and no strategy is so secret or needs so much skill as the Black
Art. Finally, if sorcery is persecuted, it excites the contra-suggestibility
which in some neurotics becomes a passion
capable of supporting them at the stake. Hence the malevolent
wizard may feel a vocation, may believe in his own
powers; and, of course, he will be confirmed in his belief by
the fear excited wherever his reputation spreads. If you
put yourself in his place whilst practising some unholy rite,
you may become aware that the secrecy, the cunning, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
danger, the villainy and the elation of it exert a peculiar
fascination, and that this is enhanced by foul and
horrible usages, such as appeal to the perverted appetites
of insanity.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The deceit employed by a wizard in conjuring, ventriloquising,
dressing up, keeping a “familiar,” choosing favourable
opportunities for his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</i> and inciting himself to
frenzy, seems incompatible with sincerity; but whilst he
knows such proceedings to be artifices, he also knows them
to be necessary to the effect which he produces. For that
effect, so far as it depends upon wizardly practices, not on
such means as massage, or poisons, or drugs, is always subjective—an
influence on other men’s belief. Are we not
demanding of him greater discrimination than he is likely
to enjoy, if we expect him to see the hollowness of his profession,
because some of the means by which he operates
are not what his clients suppose them to be? If it be said
that the wizard’s stock excuses for failure—that there has
been a mistake in the rites, or that another wizard has counteracted
his efforts—are those of a man who has anticipated
detection in fraud and prepared a way of escape, it may be
replied that, according to accepted tenets concerning wizardry,
these excuses are reasonable and not necessarily subterfuges.</p>

<p>The professional attitude may induce a man to exonerate
himself and his colleagues in certain dubious dealings, for
the sake of the public utility of their office on the whole;
which is so manifest to him and to them, and is also acknowledged
by the public. For a wizard’s belief in his art is
supported by the testimony of other wizards, in whom he
also believes, and by the belief of the tribe generally in the
power of the profession, even though he himself be not
greatly esteemed. “Who am I,” he will ask, “that I should
have a conscience of my own?” And if this attitude is
inconsistent with keen intelligence and megalomania, such
inconsistency is not inconsistent with our experience of human
nature.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The effects produced by charms, spells and rites, simple
or to the last degree elaborate, purely magical or reinforced
by spirits, are always subjective, but are believed to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
much wider range. The wizard seems to make the sun rise
when he summons it just in time every morning; to cause
clouds to gather in the sky when he invokes them just before
the rainy season; and so on. Such performances convince
others, but seem to us poor evidence for any one who is in
the secret. He is not, however, left without further evidence
of three kinds:</p>

<p>(i) From the effects of natural causes that form part of his
professional resources. Some of a wizard’s practices are really
good; <abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr> in curing the sick he may employ massage, or
sweat-baths, or skilful surgery, or medicinal drugs, or suggestion,
and thereby succeed without any Magic; whilst he
is incapable of clearly distinguishing these means from useless
rites and incantations. He does not understand intimately
why <em>any</em> method is efficacious, and therefore cannot understand
the limits of his power. His whole art is empirical.
Even in modern science explanation always ends sooner or
later (and often pretty soon) in pointing to some connexion
of phenomena which we are obliged to accept as a fact:
the wizard is always brought to this pass at the first step.
He has no generally acknowledged public standard of what
may possibly happen: it is only in the mind of a natural
positivist that a standard of common sense grows up by
experience without explicit generalisation; and this standard
is incommunicable. Hence the wizard is always trying
experimentally to extend his power—of course on the model
of his traditionary art; always desiring power, and believing
that he has obtained, because he desires it.</p>

<p>(ii) The wizard’s arts are justified by the action of natural
causes set in motion by his clients. He prepares the hunter
and his weapons for an expedition; the hunter does his best,
and his success swells the reputation of the wizard. Similarly
in agriculture, and in war. And in all these cases nothing is
really due to the wizard, except the greater confidence his
clients derive from his ministrations: the hunter’s hand is
steadier; the sower and the reaper work more cheerfully;
and the warrior fights more courageously in the belief that his
enemies are surely devoted to the infernal gods. But the
wizard, with general acquiescence, claims far more than this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and rises in his own esteem as well as in the esteem of his
tribe.</p>

<p>(iii) The persevering wizard is often aided by coincidences.
An Australian squatter at Morton’s Plains, after a drought,
promised a native rain-maker half a bullock, a bag of flour
and some tea, if he would fill his new tank for him before
the morrow night. The rain-maker set his rites and spells
to work, filled the tank and got the reward.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Whilst Messrs.
Spencer and Gillen were with the Urabunna tribe, “the
leading rain-maker performed a ceremony and within two
days there was a downpour—possibly connected with the
fact that it was the usual time for rain to fall in that part
of the country.” The reputation of the rain-maker was
firmly established, and, no doubt, his self-confidence. The
Australian wizard already mentioned, who thought that his
Magic had entered his own head, claimed to have driven
away a comet by means of his magic stones. Certainly the
comet disappeared, and what other cause could any one point
out? “At one time the gusts were very unpleasant and one
of the men told a wind-man to make it stop. Accordingly
he shouted out to the wind, and in a minute there was a lull;
and no one doubted that this was due to the power of the
wind-man.”<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Many similar cases might be given.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Striking
coincidences are not very rare: there is an illogical prejudice
that they are rare because they excite wonder. Moreover, as
I have observed, so remote a resemblance to the event
shamanised or prophesied may be regarded as a fulfilment,
that fulfilment is not uncommon. In the interpretation of
omens, where there is only the alternative of good or ill
success, half the guesses must be right; and by the glozing
of doubtful cases, more than half will seem to be right. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
as for the effect of coincidence, Mr. Basil Thompson says,
“Tongans never admit coincidences”<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>—that is to say, in
our sense of the word: for them, in what we call coincidence,
there must be causation; and this seems to be generally
true of the untutored mind. Among the Churaches, the
profession of shaman is generally hereditary; but a man
may become a shaman against his will. It is enough “to
make a lucky guess as to the issue of some event, and people
flock to him for advice from all parts.”<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> How many failures
are necessary to discredit one lucky guess?</p>

<p>These three kinds of evidence in favour of the wizard’s
power—natural causes set in motion by himself, natural
causes introduced by his clients, and sheer favourable coincidences—have
so much the air of perceptual proof, or of an
appeal to common sense, that the savage positivist who is
able to resist them must have a more solid judgment than
most of our educated civilised people. Judgment is an
innate individual character, on which education has little
effect, except in the special department of a man’s training.
A scientific expert, for example, may be an excellent judge of
evidence in his own pursuit, and elsewhere quite helpless;
for where he is strong it is not a set of rules but the mass of
his special experience that guides him. That out of the mass
of general experience, so disorderly and fragmentary as it is,
some minds should have the power of extracting common
sense, in spite of the misrepresentations of Magic and Animism,
is very remarkable, and very fortunate for the rest of us.</p>

<p>That the three kinds of evidence which serve so well to confirm
belief in wizardry are all of them—as to the connexion
between a wizard’s rites or spells and the event—entirely
coincidental, gives some support to the hypothesis that
coincidences are the foundation of the belief in Magic.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind, then, that a wizard’s practices sometimes
include real causes, and that his shallow knowledge disables
him for discriminating between causation and hocus-pocus;
that Magic or Sorcery is generally believed in by those about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
him, who seek his aid, or the aid of others of his class; that
both they and he earnestly desire that his pretensions should
be well founded; that he produces striking subjective effects;
that in such cases his artifices are a condition of his success,
and that a good many coincidences, complete or partial,
seem to prove that his art has further extraordinary influence
upon men and nature—it is no wonder that some wizards
are deluded along with their dupes, especially neurotic
enthusiasts or men of an imaginative and histrionic
temperament.</p>

<p>To explain the possibility of some men being sincere in
witchcraft is not to palliate the profession, much less the
anti-social practices of witchcraft. For the most part those
practices are deceitful. They are not the invention of savage
society; society invents nothing; only the individual invents.
They are the invention and tradition of wizards, who keep
the secret so far as it is to their advantage: of wizards
growing more and more professional, and trading upon the
fears and hopes, the anxiety and credulity of their fellows.
The spirit of superstition is common to the tribe, but its professional
exploitation is the work of those who profit by it.</p>

<p>Observing with satisfaction that, even amongst savages,
the positive mind can sometimes free itself from popular
superstitions and penetrate the disguise of mystery-mongers,
one asks why Nature could not produce whole tribes of men
so minded, and spare the folly and horror and iniquity which
take up so much space in the retrospect of human life.
Because common sense is only related to actual experience,
and could not appreciate the necessity of government and
social co-ordination as the condition of all improvement in
human life, until it already existed. Such co-ordination had,
therefore, to grow up without being understood; and it did
grow up under the protection of certain beliefs that induced
the tribes of men to hold together and subordinate themselves
to leaders: amongst which beliefs the superstitions exploited
by wizards had no small part.</p>

<br />TOTEMISM</h2>


<h3><a id="ch09_01"></a>§ 1. Meaning and Scope of Totemism</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> very much less importance in the history of culture
than Animism or Magic, Totemism interests us by its strangeness.
To be descended from a crocodile, or blood-brother
to the crow, or “the same as a kangaroo” must be, we think,
the grotesque notion of a lunatic. We never meet people who
believe such a thing; it has no stronghold in our own breasts.
So much the more surprising that it should, nevertheless, be
widely entertained. It is, indeed, far from universal among
mankind, probably much less ancient than Animism and
certainly far less enduring. Where it has prevailed it is
sometimes quite forgotten; and in the higher stages of human
development it has no influence. But every student of early
institutions finds it necessary to give himself some intelligible
account of its nature and sources.</p>

<p>“A Totem,” says Sir James Frazer, “is a class of material
objects which a savage regards with superstitious respect,
believing that there exists between him and every member of
the class an intimate and altogether special relation.”<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>
<p>This definition is scientifically drawn so as to include what is
common to all Totems and not to include any character that
is not universally connected with them. It is true of the
Totems of individuals (or guardian genii), very common among
the Northern Amerinds; as well as of the Sex-Totems (say
Bat for men and Owl for women) which occur in Australia;
and of the Totems of clans found in many parts of the world,
of which the Australian may be supposed most nearly to
represent the original institution. When one speaks of
Totems without qualification, one means these Clan-Totems,
being incomparably the most important: others probably
derive from them.</p>

<p>“The Clan-Totem” (to quote the same source) “is reverenced
by a body of men and women who call themselves by
the name of the Totem, believe themselves to be of one blood,
descendants of a common ancestor, and are bound together
by common obligations to each other and by a common faith
in the Totem.”<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> This definition is also strict: whereas it is
not uncommon for writers on Totemism to include in their
notion of the Totem other characters which are accidents more
or less often associated with it: as that the clan believes
itself descended from the Totem; though in many cases the
clan traces its origin to something that was neither Totem
nor man, or regards the Totem animal as descended from
their own human ancestress, or tells some story of the transformation
of a man into an animal, or of an animal into a man,
or of an ancestor’s friendship with the Totem animal; for the
institution is a copious source of explanatory myths. Again,
it may be written that no member of a clan may kill or injure
the Totem, or eat, or utilise it (if an animal or plant); and
this is often, but not always true. If the Totem is water,
or the most important food in the district—dugong, turtle,
coconut, sago—abstention is impossible or intolerably inconvenient.
Hence among the Kaitish a Water clansman
when alone may drink; but if others are with him he may
drink only when water is given him by a man of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Totem. And to eat a little of the Totem sacramentally, in
order to confirm one’s identity with it, may be allowed or
(rather) required. Among the Warramunga the Snake clan
may kill snakes. It may even be the clan’s duty to destroy
or drive away their Totem; as happens with the Mosquito
clan of the Kakadus in North Australia, and with the Reptile
clan amongst the Omahas. Similarly, the clan sometimes,
but by no means always, imitate the Totem in character,
in costume, in dances, or bear in tattoo or otherwise its badge
to manifest the community of nature. They may be thought
to have special magical powers to influence its fertility or to
control its actions (actions of game or wind or rain), and may
use these powers for the benefit of the tribe. At death the
soul of a clansman may pass into, or may appear as, the
Totem animal. The Totem may be the protector of its
clansmen, and in some cases it seems to have become a god.
These accidents of Totemism, however, are very irregularly
diffused and some of them are rare.</p>

<p>Most important socially is the connexion between Totemism
and Marriage-customs. In the great majority of cases, men
and women of the same Totem may not intermarry; the
Totem clans are said to be exogamous; but there are exceptions
even to this rule. In many parts of the world—America,
Africa, India, Indonesia, as well as Australia—tribes are
divided into non-intermarrying or exogamous classes (moieties
or phratries); sometimes the classes are subdivided, and even
the sub-classes again (in parts of Australia), so that in all the
exogamous classes are eight; and the rules concerning these
classes are such as to prevent the marriage of brothers and
sisters, parents and children and first cousins. The Totem
clans are usually distributed amongst the Marriage-classes;
being probably the older institution (whether or not originally
exogamous), they may be said to have been subordinated
by the formation of the classes; and in the matter of marriage
they follow the class rules. But the Arunta with some neighbouring
tribes of Central Australia, though divided into eight
exogamous classes, have not subordinated the Totem clans;
which, accordingly, are not exogamous. If Exogamy was
originally the vital utility of Totemism, the institution is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
undermined by the Marriage-classes, whether the clans are
subordinated to the classes and merely repeat their rules,
or are not subordinated and lose their Exogamy. This may
explain why the classes prevail more widely than Totems,
and may be found where Totemism seems to have become
extinct.</p>


<h3><a id="ch09_02"></a>§ 2. Of the Origin of Totemism</h3>

<p>It has already been said that Totemism does not prevail
universally amongst mankind. There is very little evidence
of its having existed amongst the ancestors of the Indo-European
peoples; and it seems to be unknown to many of
the most primitive of surviving tribes—the Boschmans,
Veddas, Puranas (Borneo), Andamanese, Yaghans (Tierra
del Fuego) and Californian Indians. It is not, therefore,
something founded in human nature itself, but must have
originated (whether in one or in several places) under particular
conditions.</p>

<p>There is some probability that the earliest Totems were
animals. Wherever Totems are found most of them are
animals. A list of Totems recognised in North Australia,
given by Spencer and Gillen,<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> comprises 202 altogether:
Animals 164,<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> Plants 22, Inanimate 16. The animals (except
insects) and plants are nearly all edible. To hunters animals
must have been of all things the most interesting; next,
certain plants, especially to women. Animals lend the greatest
plausibility to any notion of blood-relationship. The
inanimate Totems include some which it is very desirable to
control by Magic, such as Water, Wind, Fire, Sun, Moon and
the Boomerang.</p>

<p>Generally, no doubt, Totemism is ancient; but in some
cases the existing Totems must be recent, as among the
Bahima of Uganda.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Nearly all their Totems are different
coloured cows, or some part of a cow, and must have been
adopted since the advance to pastoral life—at a stage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
culture, therefore, much above the Australian. “Split
Totems,” arising on the division of a clan by dividing its
Totem (as the Omahas comprised Buffalo-heads, Buffalo-tails,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>), were probably formed by deliberate agreement, and
had the incidental advantage that a clansman’s food-taboo
did not extend to the whole buffalo, the staple food of the
tribe, but only to the head or tail.</p>

<p>Amongst the Australian aborigines, the group of beliefs
and practices included in, or connected with, Totemism are of
such intense and widespread social importance, that it must
have prevailed amongst them for many generations. The
northern Amerinds are so much in advance of the Australians
in social organisation, culture and mentality, that if their
Totemism has descended to them from a time when they lived
at the Australian level, its history must go back not merely
for many generations but for thousands of years. And if
Egyptian gods, such as Hathor and Anubis, were formerly
Totems, the retrospect becomes still longer. I am not aware
of any direct evidence of the prehistoric existence of Totemism,
such as we have, in some ancient burials, of the existence
of Animism; but some palæolithic carvings or paintings may
have had totemic significance.</p>

<p>It follows that any account of the origin of Totemism can
only be hypothetical. Were this all, indeed, it would be
on the same foot with Magic and Animism; but it is not all.
That Magic should arise from belief in mysterious forces and
from confusing coincidence with causation, or that Animism
should result from a confusion between dreams and objective
experience (with the help of Magic-ideas) is highly probable;
because such errors are active to this day, and they seem to
spring up in primitive minds by psychological necessity;
though it may not be intrinsically necessary that the errors
should be perpetuated and systematised as, in general, they
have been. But the case of Totemism is different; for we do
not see—at least, no one has yet shown—any sort of necessity
why in certain cases clans should have borne the names of
certain animals: and this is the root of the whole matter.
Indeed, this practice, not being universal, cannot be necessary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and it may have had several different origins. Any relevant
hypothesis, therefore, can claim no more than to agree with the
known facts better than rival hypotheses; we cannot expect
to deduce it from laws of human nature; whilst still another
hypothesis just as good may any day be put forward by some
speculative genius; and the doubt must always remain
whether some important facts of Totemism have not been
lost which, could they be recovered, would prove all our
guesses to have been made in vain.</p>

<p>In spite of these discouraging considerations, several
hypotheses have been proposed: this also is for us a sort
of psychological necessity. They may be grouped into two
classes, according as they assume the totemic names to have
been originally names of individuals or of whole clans. All
seem to assume that one explanation must hold good for all
the cases.</p>

<p>Of hypotheses that trace totemic names to individuals
there is, first, Spencer’s; namely, that the name of an animal
or plant was first given to an individual, and then inherited
by his family; who after a time forgot his personality,
remembered only their descent from such a name, and
assumed that their ancestor must have been an animal or
plant such as still bore that name. Secondly, there is the
explanation offered by Prof. Franz Boas, that the first Totems
were guardian spirits of individuals, and that these became
Clan-Totems of their descendants. For this account it may be
said that among the Northern Amerinds the belief in guardian
spirits of individuals (generally some animal) is universally
diffused, and perhaps of greater importance than the Clan-Totems,
seeing that these are subordinate to the Marriage-classes:
moreover, the Totems are rarely, if ever, believed
to have been ancestors. On the other hand, in Australia,
guardian spirits of individuals are rare, whilst Totemism is
universal. So that, if we suppose only one origin of the
institution, it is more reasonable to view the guardian spirit
as derived from the Clan-Totem. In Borneo we find the
guardian spirit with some traits similar to the American, but
much less generally, whilst there is now no plainly marked
Totemism: but there are several beliefs akin to those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Totemism which may be marks of its former existence; and,
if so, the guardian spirit may also be one of its relics.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Thirdly,
Frazer’s hypothesis, that Totems originated in the fancies
of pregnant women, who, ignorant of physiological causes,
supposed that that which stirred within them must be some
animal or plant that had entered them; so that the child when
born could be no other than that animal or plant.</p>

<p>Of hypotheses which regard totemic names as from the
first names of groups we have, first, Max Müller’s, that they
originated with clan marks.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> But in Australia clan marks
are not often to be found. Secondly, Professor F.&nbsp;B. Jevons’,
that the Totem was originally some animal adopted by the
tribe as a friendly natural power, aiding them in the struggle
for existence.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> But, if so, this character seems to have been
lost, or greatly attenuated in Australia, and in America
belongs to the guardian spirit rather than to the Totem.
Thirdly, Dr. Haddon’s, that the Totem name was derived
by a group from the animal or plant which was its principal
food; but cases to support this suggestion are very few.
Fourthly, Andrew Lang’s, that group names were obtained in
some way—perhaps imposed upon each group by others, and
accepted; and that names of animals or plants having been
obtained in any way, and the origin forgotten, just such beliefs
concerning the relation of the group to its namesake would
be likely to arise, as in fact we find amongst Totemists.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>For want of space to discuss all these doctrines I shall
deal chiefly with those of Frazer and Lang.</p>


<h3><a id="ch09_03"></a>§ 3. The Conceptional Hypothesis</h3>

<p>Sir J. G. Frazer, after very candidly relinquishing two early
suggestions—by no means fanciful—concerning the origin
of Totemism, as unsupported by sufficient evidence, has put
forward a third—“conceptional Totemism”—which occurred
to him upon the discovery by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen of the
doctrine of totemic descent prevalent amongst the Arunta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and allied tribes. These tribes are said not to be aware of
the connexion between sexual intercourse and pregnancy.
They say that a child is the result of the entry into a woman of
the spirit of some pre-existing tribesman of this or that Totem;
which, therefore, will also be the child’s. What Totem it is
depends upon the place where the woman first becomes aware
of quickening; for there are certain places known to the
natives where the people of such or such a Totem “went into
the ground” [perhaps were buried]; and in passing such a
place any woman is liable to be impregnated by one of the
discarnate spirits; who are always on the look-out for an
opportunity to re-enter the mortal state. This is the real
cause of pregnancy, for which marriage is merely a preparation.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
A young woman who does not desire the dignity of a
matron, when passing such haunted ground, runs crouching
by, and cries out that she is an old woman; for facility in
being deceived is a saving grace of spirits. In modified forms
this doctrine of “no paternity and re-incarnation” is professed
by tribes throughout the centre and north of the continent,
in Queensland and in parts of West Australia.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>The Arunta doctrine of conception by animal or plant
spirits cannot, however, be the origin of Totemism; because,
as Sir James Frazer points out, the impregnating spirits are
already totemic. One must, therefore, suppose (he says)
an earlier state of things, in which a woman, ignorant of the
true causes of childbirth, imagined at the first symptoms of
pregnancy (by which the quickening seems to be meant) that
she had been entered by some object, or by the spirit of some
object, which had been engaging her attention at the time,
or which she may have been eating—a wallaby, emu, plum
or grass-seed—and later believed that the child she bare must
be, or be an incarnation of, that object or spirit, and in fact
nothing else than a wallaby, emu, plum or grass-seed with the
appearance of a human being. If other women had similar
experiences in connexion with other animals or plants, and
if the descendants of their children remembered the stories,
and considered themselves to be wallabies, grass-seed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
so forth, the hypothesis would fully explain that identification
of groups of men with groups of things which is characteristic
of Totemism; and the other characters naturally follow.
Such is the conceptional theory of Totemism, deriving that
institution from “the sick fancies of pregnant women.”<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>Circumstances, which Sir James Frazer regards as very
similar to those which he imagined as having prevailed at
some former time amongst the Arunta, have been discovered
by Dr. Rivers at Mota and Motlar in the Banks Islands.
There many people are “by the custom of the island” not
permitted to eat certain animals or fruits or even to touch
certain trees; because they are believed to <em>be</em> those animals
or plants—their mothers having suffered some influence
from such animals or plants at conception or at some subsequent
period of pregnancy. “The course of events is usually
as follows: a woman, sitting down in her garden, or in the
bush, or on the shore, finds an animal or fruit in her loin-cloth.
She takes it up and carries it to the village, where she asks
the meaning of the appearance. The people say that she
will give birth to a child who will have the characters of
this animal, or even (it appeared) would be himself or herself
that animal.”<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> She takes it to its proper home, tries to keep
it, and feeds it; but after a time it will disappear, and is then
believed to have entered into her. There is no belief in physical
impregnation by the animal, nor of its invading the woman
as a physical object; such an animal seems to be considered
as “more or less supernatural, a spirit-animal, from the beginning.”
“The belief is not accompanied by any ignorance
of the physical rôle of the human father.” Apparently the
prohibition against eating animals or plants thus connected
with oneself rests on the idea that it would amount to eating
oneself—a sort of cannibalism. One partakes of its physical
and mental characters. But the resemblance to, and the
taboo on eating, a certain animal are individual matters;
there is no belief in their being passed on to one’s descendants.
In this alone the belief at Mota falls short of Totemism.
“Yet it occurs in a people whose social system has no totemic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
features at the present time, whatever it may have had in
the past.”<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Possibly former Totem-clans have been merged
in secret societies, but there is no clear evidence of it. In
Melanesia, Totemism occurs in Fiji, Shortland Islands, Bismarck
Archipelago (probably), Reef Islands, Santa Cruz,
Vanikolo and in some regions of the Solomon Islands, but
not in the Banks Islands nor in the Torres Islands to the
south.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>This hypothesis that Totemism is derived from the fancies
of women concerning the causes of their own pregnancy
suggests several adverse considerations. In the first place,
it is to me incredible that the Arunta are really ignorant of
paternity; young women and children perhaps may be, but
not the seniors. My reasons for thinking so are set out at
length in the <cite>J.R.A.I.</cite>, 1819 (p. 146), namely, that the facts
of childbirth are too interesting to be overlooked or misconstrued,
and are well within the grasp of savage understanding;
that those who think the Arunta capable of such stupidity
have attended too exclusively to particular incidents of pregnancy,
especially the quickening, and have not considered
that there is a definite series of closely connected incidents;
that there is testimony, not to be lightly put aside, that the
old men know the truth in the case of human beings, and that
knowledge of the parallel phenomena amongst animals is
shared even by the Arunta children; that it is possible for
knowledge to be repressed by dogma without being extinguished;
that this is an old man’s dogma, and that we must
not assume that in Australia, any more than in Europe,
what people are accustomed to say is good evidence of what
they really believe;<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> that other tribes at the same level of
culture, in South-East Australia, are so convinced of the
importance of paternity that they say the child proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
entirely from the father; that those who deny paternity
show by their customs and myths that they are secretly
aware of it; and, finally, that in some cases they have clear
motives for maintaining the dogma and suppressing the truth.</p>

<p>Secondly, the observations of Dr. Rivers in the Banks
Islands give not the slightest support to the conceptional
hypothesis. For (<i>a</i>) the Banks Islands belief “is not accompanied
by any ignorance of the physical rôle of the human
father.” (<i>b</i>) The belief is that the child born to a woman
who has been visited by a plant or animal is in some way
“influenced” by the experience; not, as with the Arunta,
that it is entirely due to it (except for some “preparation”
by the father). (<i>c</i>) Before the Banks Islands belief can give
rise to Totemism there must be a belief in the continuous
inheritance of the plant or animal influence; and not only
is this absent, but there is a strong tendency to prevent it.
A woman having been influenced by an eel, her child is an
eel; but if that child be a girl, there is no further transmission
of eel-like qualities; the girl, on becoming pregnant, may
be influenced by a yam, and then her child will be a yam.
This hinders the formation of a group of human beings
mysteriously allied to an animal or plant, such as Totemism
implies. But (<i>d</i>) the conceptional hypothesis refers the
origin of Totemism to the ignorant imaginings of women
themselves, who think they have been entered by this or
that; whereas in the Banks Islands a woman’s belief in
the influence of an animal or plant upon her offspring is
not prompted by her own fancy, but by a popular superstition.
For when she carries the thing found in her loin-cloth to the
village, “the people say” she will give birth to a child who
will have the qualities of, or even will be that thing; and a
child afterwards born may not eat or touch that thing “by
the custom of the country.” Had the Arunta, then, of
pre-totemic days such a superstition and custom for the guidance
of mothers? If so, the history of that superstition and
custom must be more obscure than Totemism itself. But in
the Banks Islands their origin may admit of a wide solution;
for although it is said that no manifest traces of Totemism
are to be found there now; yet, seeing that the Australians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Papuans, Polynesians and the Melanesians to the north
all have Totemism or plain vestiges of it, the improbability
that Melanesians in the Banks Islands never had it is very
great; and it is reasonable to suppose that the superstition
concerning the influence of animals or plants upon pregnant
women, and the taboo upon the eating of such an animal or
plant by the offspring, represent not a possible origin of
Totemism, but a survival of it.</p>

<p>These considerations raise a further question as to the
employment of the Comparative Method. Natives of the
Banks Islands are far in advance of the Arunta in all the arts
of life, as well as in relation to Totemism which they seem to
have outlived. Is it admissible to take some trait of their
life as an example of what may have existed amongst the
Arunta at a stage of culture which is generally assumed to
have been inferior even to the present? When the antecedents
of an institution have been lost amongst any given
people, and we set out to supply them from parallel cases
amongst other peoples, must we not require the same relative
order of development? If a social phenomenon is found in
the Banks Islands, its possibility is proved; but strictly it
was possible only where it occurred: elsewhere we can expect
only something similar, according to the similarity of other
relevant circumstances. Comparing the Banks Islands and
their people with Central Australia and its people, one discovers
hardly anything common to them. And Arunta
tradition (whatever worth) shows no sign of anything like the
southern Melanesian culture: the Alcheringa ancestors are
represented as having been already Totemists. To assume,
however, that the former condition of the Arunta was even
lower than the present, may not be justifiable: social degeneration
is not uncommon. There would be something to guide
our judgment if we knew how recently the desiccation of
their country approached its present severity. But, in any
case, can we suppose it to have been at all like the Melanesian?</p>


<h3><a id="ch09_04"></a>§ 4. Andrew Lang’s Hypothesis</h3>

<p>In some very remote age—to summarise Lang’s statement—at
a level of culture inferior to that of existing Australians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
distinctive names were acquired by small groups of mankind.
Since a group needs names for other groups more than for
itself (for itself it consists of “men” as contrasted with other
kinds of animals), names may at first have been bestowed upon
each group by some other, or others, in its neighbourhood—probably
names of animals or plants—and accepted by each;
for no opprobrium attaches to such names. In <cite>Social Origins</cite>
Lang offers evidence concerning names (even depreciatory and
mocking names) having been conferred in this way and
accepted; but in <cite>The Secret of the Totem</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> he says that how
groups got their names is not essential to his theory. They
may have been given, or adopted, on account of a group’s
staple food (Haddon); or because of some animal or plant
characteristic of a group’s territory; or for some fancied
resemblance of its members to some animal. The important
point is that, from the first, they were names of groups—not
derived from the names of individuals. At the early period
assumed for these events there was not a long enough memory
of individuals to make their names traditionary; and, indeed,
the reckoning of descent in the female line (which Lang regards
as universally the most ancient custom) must have prevented
the inheritance of the names of male ancestors.</p>

<p>Whatever may have occasioned the first fixing of names,
with the flight of time the circumstances were forgotten; and
groups of men and women found themselves with names—the
names of animals or plants—without knowing why. The
bearing of a name in common with an animal or plant inevitably
suggested to the savage a mysterious connexion with
the species—perhaps that they had the same sort of soul. It
gave rise to an explanatory myth, and the analogy of family
relationship suggested a blood-bond: the animal or plant must
be one’s ancestor, brother, or primal ancestral form. From
this idea follows a regard for it, respect, reverence: it must
not be killed, or eaten, or used in any way; it may be protected,
may be helpful; it is a Totem.</p>

<p>The connexion of Totemism with Exogamy (the custom of
marrying outside the group or kin) Lang conceives of in this
way. Adopting a suggestion of Darwin’s,<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> and the scheme of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
his cousin, J.&nbsp;J. Atkinson in <cite>Primal Law</cite>, that the primary
human group consisted of a powerful male with one or more
wives and their children, he argues that the jealousy of the
head of this family imposed the rule—“No male to touch the
females in my camp.” The sons, therefore, as they grew up,
were driven out, and must find wives elsewhere. This was
the beginning of Exogamy, and it may have preceded the
rise of Totemism; but Totemism, once established, strengthened
the custom of Exogamy by mysterious sanctions. As
the Totem might not be eaten, or in any way used or touched,
so a woman of the same Totem could not be married; and
that not only within their immediate family-group, but not
even by a male of any group having the same Totem.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>In maintaining this hypothesis against those who would
derive Totems from the names and traditions of individuals,
Lang seems to me to lay too much stress upon the difficulty
of establishing a tradition of descent amongst people who
trace descent (as he would say) “on the spindle side.” If
the tradition began from a woman (as it might do), there is
no difficulty; and even if it began from a man, it is conceivable
that his women-folk should adopt it. Moreover, in
the opinion of both Westermarck and Frazer, it has not been
shown that the reckoning of descent in the female line is
original and universal. Still, the further we push back the
origin of Totemism the more difficult it is to understand
the growth of a tradition of the descent and inheritance of
the name and personal qualities of an individual; and this
difficulty is avoided by an hypothesis which derives Totemism
from the animal- or plant-names of groups of men and women.
That such names were conferred upon each group by others
in the neighbourhood is a reasonable conjecture;<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
earliest names of groups they cannot be called nicknames; and
the names of animals or plants need in no way have been
offensive. It is still more reasonable to urge that, having
been adopted by a group, the circumstances of their acquisition
would, in a few generations, be forgotten, and that they would
then become the ground of myths and mysterious totemic
beliefs. But does any one think that it will now ever be
possible to decide with confidence where, when, how or why
the names were given at first? I do not.</p>

<p>As to the origin of Exogamy, I cannot believe that the
primitive human groups were such as Lang described; and, if
not, some other origin of that custom must be sought.</p>


<h3><a id="ch09_05"></a>§ 5. Totemism and Marriage</h3>

<p>Generally men and women of the same Totem cannot
marry. Tribes, such as the Arunta, that do not observe
this rule are so few that it is reasonable to consider them
aberrant; so that in each case the non-coincidence of Totemism
and Exogamy is a distinct problem.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there is reason to think that these institutions
have not the same origin. For several primitive tribes,
some of them inferior in culture to the average Australian,
have customs of Exogamy, or (at least) forbidding marriage
between individuals of some certain description, who have
not, and are not known ever to have recognised Totemism.
Many tribes, again, who by their ethnological position may be
supposed once to have entertained Totemism, have abandoned
it, but still maintain Exogamy by means of Marriage-classes
(phratries) or otherwise. Further, many nations of advanced
culture cannot be shown ever to have been totemists, but
have always (as far back as can be traced) enforced Exogamy
so far as to prohibit marriage within certain degrees of kindred.
And that the connexion between Totemism and
Exogamy is not original but acquired, is indicated by the
consideration that the most obvious tendency of Totemism
would be to favour Endogamy (the practice of not marrying
outside certain limits), on the obvious principle that as an
animal kangaroo mates with an animal kangaroo, so a human
kangaroo should marry a human kangaroo. This is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
obvious that the opposite rule that a human kangaroo must
not marry another one, but (zoological paradox!) only an emu
or a witchety-grub, seems perverse, and only to be explained
by the influence of some superstition or incidental custom.
According to Arunta tradition, their ancestors in the
Alcheringa were endogamous.</p>

<p>Whether Exogamy originated in the days of the hunting-pack—which
is so far probable that the Boschmans observed
it—or during the reconstitution of society after the breaking
up of the packs, or even later, or in some regions at one period,
in others at another, is, I fear, beyond our power of verifiable
guessing. The best hypothesis as to the grounds of the custom
is Westermarck’s, namely, that an instinct of mutual avoidance
grew up between near kin. This requires that at the time
of its origination promiscuity of sexual relations should not
have prevailed in the human stock, since that would have
destroyed the conditions necessary to the rise of such an
instinct. If promiscuity was ever widely practised, it must
have been after the breaking up of the hunting-packs. That
at some stage of human life, and apparently with some
Australian tribes not a remote one, promiscuity was established,
has been argued (on the ground of some Australian
customs) with much plausibility; but in his <cite>History of Human
Marriage</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Westermarck has examined this opinion very
carefully, and concludes that it is not tenable. His reasoning
seems to me good throughout; and, having nothing important
to add to it, I refer the reader to his work.</p>

<p>Whether amongst anthropoids any instinctive avoidance
prevails, preventing what we conceive of as incest, nobody
knows. With their solitary families, the growth of such a
disposition may be more difficult than amongst gregarious
animals (such as our ancestors had become long before they
could be called “human”), who find other families at hand
to intermarry with; though the primitive human bands
probably were not large. Savages now at the lowest level,
such as the Veddas or Yaghans, rarely form parties of more
than thirty or forty. The Boschmans, before their tribal
habits were destroyed in the early years of last century, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
sometimes assembling in large numbers for the great hunts by
means of stockade traps, yet were usually scattered in groups
of a few families. It is not likely that their remote forefathers
consorted in larger numbers: eight or ten families
may have been enough to co-operate in hunting, or in mutual
defence. Within each family constituting such a band the
tendency to Exogamy may first have manifested itself.</p>

<p>Westermarck’s hypothesis concerning Exogamy was first
published in the <cite>History of Human Marriage</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> and has been
re-stated in <cite>The Origin and Development of Moral Ideas</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> In
the former work he fully discusses the evidence as to the effects
of the inter-breeding of near kin, and concludes that it is
probably injurious. The evidence is conflicting, but his
conclusion seems to me justifiable. And he rightly points out
that if, amongst civilised nations, the mischief of inbreeding
is not always manifest, it was probably much greater amongst
primitive savages: (1) because the blood of the stock was
purer; for in modern Europe (<abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>) every marriage brings
together many different strains. (2) Because communities
were then much smaller; so that under endogamous conditions
whatever vice may beset inbreeding would, generation
after generation, be perpetuated and exaggerated without
relief. It may be added that with Endogamy the young folk
are likely to begin to breed earlier—perhaps by two or three
years—than they would with Exogamy; and there is no doubt
that the marriage of immature individuals is highly injurious
to the race.</p>

<p>But if inbreeding was injurious, Natural Selection favoured
any family or band that practised Exogamy. That any should
have done so on rational grounds, to avoid the observed evil
effects of inbreeding, cannot be supposed. The motive must
have been blind to the consequences, and may have taken the
form of coldness toward those of opposite sex with whom one
had grown up from infancy, or of aversion to the idea of
marrying them. Such dispositions Natural Selection preserved,
and they have descended to ourselves; for such was
the beginning of the abhorrence of incest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>I conjecture that this feeling first showed itself within
the family, and led the families of a band to exchange their
daughters; and that later it extended to all members of the
same band, and that wives were then sought from other bands.
Probably wives were obtained sometimes by capture or enticement,
sometimes by exchange so far as amicable relations with
neighbours prevailed: for the evidence is far from showing
that “marriage by capture” was ever a general custom;
whilst our knowledge of the Australians and Boschmans shows
that neighbouring bands of savages are not always hostile.</p>

<p>Such a state of things may have existed for ages before
the rise of Totemism, and amongst races that never adopted
Totemism. When names of animals were first given to, or
adopted by, various groups, Totemism somewhere (perhaps in
several places) resulted, as a belief in the magical or spiritual
connexion between men and animals of the same name. But
the bands that adopted Totemism were already exogamous,
having an aversion to marriage with others of the same band;
and the practice of Exogamy was thus brought under the
mysterious sanction of totemic ideas. It would then be
further extended to bar marriage with those of the same Totem
in other groups.</p>

<p>Totemic sanctions may have been useful in confirming the
Exogamy of some groups, but all superstitious aids to right
conduct are liable to perverse issues, and at best they are
second best. Totemism prevents consanguineous marriages,
but also prevents marriage with thousands of people where no
blood-relationship is traceable. If any races were able to
perceive that the interest of Exogamy was the prevention of
marriage between near kin, and then to keep account of kinship
and govern themselves accordingly, they chose the better
part.</p>

<p>Some exceptions to the rule that Totem-clans are exogamous
may, perhaps, be explained by supposing that certain bands
had not adopted Exogamy when they became totemists—may
not this have happened amongst the Arunta?—and that they
have since learnt Exogamy under other conditions from neighbouring
people, or by conquest. Amongst the other possible
conditions there are the remarkable Marriage-classes, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
phratries that prevail in Australia, North America, and less
regularly in other parts of the world. These Marriage-classes
are considered by some ethnologists to be of deliberate
institution—a reform for the regulation of Exogamy; and
Spencer and Gillen, who knew the Australians so intimately,
thought such a law—though its intricacy astonishes most
Europeans and stumbles many—was not beyond their power
of excogitation. Upon that point it would be absurd of me
to have any opinion. But to suppose deliberate intention
is contrary to the usual method of interpreting savage institutions:
a savage language is a system of customs much more
intricate and refined than the Marriage-classes, and not generally
believed to have originated with the deliberate enactment
of rules of grammar. I conjecture that those classes resulted
at first from a grouping of exogamous Totem-clans which grew
up by custom, and that the only deliberate work consisted
in some minor adjustments of clan-relations. Marriage of
cousins is prevented in Central and North Australia by the
recognition of eight sub-classes; but the same result is obtained
in other tribes by a custom which merely forbids it.
Exogamous classes having been established in some tribes,
may have been imitated in others.</p>

<p>One result of the classificatory marriage system, however
it grew up, is the extended use of names of kinship to denote
all individuals of the same or corresponding generation—“father”
for all men who might by custom have married
your mother; “brother” and “sister” for all men and
women descended from those whom your father or mother
might have married; “husband” or “wife” for any man
or woman whom, according to custom, you might have married.
When further progress has been made in culture,
distinctive names are used to express blood-relationship and
class-relationship. It may be worth considering whether,
in Australia, some of the customs which have been supposed
to bear witness to an original state of promiscuity are not
really results of the classificatory system of naming relationship:
marital rights having been claimed on the ground of
the names “husband” and “wife” as used in that system.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="ch09_06"></a>§ 6. The Clansman and his Totem</h3>

<p>The relationship of Clansman to Totem may be conceived
of as one of friendliness, protection, consanguinity, or even
identity; and this last I take to be the case in the age when
Totemism is most alive and powerful. But in what sense
can a man be the same as an emu? He may be of the same
name; but by itself that would be nothing. It is not the
name, but the identity which the name has come to signify
that must be considered. Some light may be shed upon
the problem by the saying of a native to Spencer and Gillen,
pointing to a photograph of himself: “That one is just the
same as me; so is a kangaroo.” The photograph might be
“the same” as himself in the sense of resemblance; but in
that sense the kangaroo is not the same. Some, indeed, who
have speculated on the savage mind suppose that it is not
only incapable of reasoning, but even of perceiving the facts
before it, when under the influence of some strong belief;
and I admit that this is sometimes true. But all a savage’s
actions in relation to his Totem show that he is aware of
the difference: not least his efforts on certain occasions to
help his imagination to establish identity by disguising
himself and by imitating the actions of this strange other
self, and by eating a little of it to insure physical identity
at least to that extent. He also seeks to multiply it that
others may eat their ration, and for any theory of his identity
with the Totem, this must be a puzzle.</p>

<p>But a photograph may be the same as oneself in another
sense than mere superficial resemblance: it may, like a
shadow or reflection, be (or contain) a man’s soul, or part of
it. And similarly a kangaroo or other Totem may be conceived
to be the same as a man, that is, as having the same
soul. Perhaps this is as near as we can get to the Australian’s
meaning in the above-quoted confession of faith. It is
reconcilable with the ceremonial eating of some part of the
Totem; for that will convey spiritual as well as physical
properties: and to reconcile it with the multiplication of
the Totem that others may eat, I point to the biological
necessity that each clan’s Totem should be food for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
other tribesmen. Where all edible animals and plants are
Totems, how else can they subsist? But we have several
times seen that biological necessity will place limits to a
belief, and that excuses can be found for necessary actions
which are in conflict with a belief. That the clansmen give
their own Totem to the tribe (since they cannot defend it)
is an ingenious compromise.</p>

<p>It is reported that amongst the Euahlayi tribe occur
personal Totems (or guardians, rare in Australia) called
Yunbeai, possessed chiefly by wizards. A man may eat his
hereditary Totem, but not his Yunbeai; which in this privilege
seems to have supplanted the Totem. His spirit is in
the Yunbeai, and its spirit is in him.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> They have, then,
the same soul; and, although this belief is not strictly
Totemism, it is probably derived from it. A clansman of
the Yuin tribe (West Australia) had as his Totem the Black
Duck, which warned him against enemies; and he related
that once, whilst he slept, a Lace-Lizard man sent his Totem,
which went down his throat and almost ate his Black Duck
residing in his breast; so that he nearly died.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Were not
his Black Duck and his soul the same?</p>

<p>This hypothesis agrees very well with a belief that one’s
body and soul descend from the same ancestor as the Totem’s;
and that at death one goes to, or becomes, the Totem; and
excuses the fiction that the quickening of a pregnant woman
may be caused by the entry into her of the spirit of some
totem-plant or animal.</p>

<p>On the Gold Coast and elsewhere in West Africa, a man
has more than one soul, it may be as many as four; and one
of them dwells with some animal in the bush: thence called
his “bush-soul.” Sir James Frazer’s first hypothesis concerning
Totemism was that it may have been derived from
the notion of an external soul which may be deposited in
anything (as thus in an animal in the bush) for safety. He
now thinks the connexion of the “bush-soul” with Totemism
uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> If there has been any connexion, may it not
be that the “bush-soul” is derived from Totemism, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
that every Totem is a sort of “bush-soul”—that is, it has a
soul which is the same (at least, of the same kind) as the
clansman’s?</p>


<h3><a id="ch09_07"></a>§ 7. Totemism and Magic</h3>

<p>The identity of a man with his name, as usually assumed
by savages, whether his personal or his totemic name, is not
itself a magical belief, but an inevitable result of mental
association at a low level of intelligence: perhaps earlier
than any notions that can properly be called magical. The
name of a man, always thought of along with his other
properties, seems to be as much one of them as a scar on his
neck or any peculiar trait of visage or length of limb. This
must be as old as naming. But such a complication of the
name with other marks having been formed, it becomes
the ground of magic beliefs and practices. To mention the
name of a man or spirit insures his presence and participation
in any rite, either acting or suffering; or where writing is
known, his name on a piece of paper is as good as his nail-parings.
The use of the name is not a mere animistic
summons (which might be disobeyed), but an immediate
instatement of the given individual. Such magic may
enter into totemic observances.</p>

<p>The descent of the clan from the Totem-animal, or of the
animal from a forefather of the clan, or of both from a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tertium
quid</i>, involves metamorphosis; and this, again, is not itself
a magic idea; for real metamorphoses are common in the
life of birds, amphibia, insects, and it would be unreasonable
to expect savages to perceive clearly that these are not
parallel cases. There is a difference, however, between
transformations that may be observed, such as that of a
chrysalis into a butterfly, and those that have never been
observed, but are merely imagined and asserted. The latter
are more mysterious, and mystery is one character of magic.
For example, the Witchety-Grub clan among the Arunta
have as their mate a bird, the chantunga, which they will
not eat because, they say, of old some full-grown witchety-grubs
were transformed into these birds.<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> This change has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
a magical character, though no magical agency is assigned.
But if any attempt were made to explain how the great
change took place, recourse might be had to powers of magic.
Even when agency is assigned, it is not always magical. In
the earliest Alcheringa the two Ungambikula (“out of
nothing”) saw in groups by the shore of the salt water a
number of inapertwa, rudimentary men, mere roundish
masses, without organs or means of feeding, and these they
cut out into men with stone knives, therefore not by magic.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
But, again, a tribe on the Darling River (Wathi-wathi) have
traditions concerning Bookoomuri who lived long ago,
excelled in Magic, and transformed themselves into animals;
and here the magical power is asserted, though the manner
of its operation is indefinite. But the Bear clan of the
Tshimshians (British Columbia) explain their position by
the story that once upon a time an Indian, whilst hunting,
met a bear, which took him to its home, where he stayed
two years. On returning to his village he looked like a bear;
but, having been rubbed with medical herbs, recovered
human shape.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> And here the magic is as explicit as in any
recipe for a were-wolf, or that fallacious ointment with which
Lucius achieved his memorable transformation.</p>

<p>Nor, further, has the prohibition to slay, injure or eat
the Totem in the first place any magical significance; for
it merely puts the Totem in the position of a clansman. But
the situation, being strange and mysterious, acquires a
magical atmosphere; and the enforcement of the taboo by
penalties is unmistakably magical. The Untmajera (North
Central Australia) have a legend of a Beetle-Grub man of
former times who ate beetle-grubs, and thereupon broke
out in sores, wasted away and died. Or one’s hair may
turn grey; or, according to the Samoan belief (not strictly
totemistic), the forbidden food may grow inside one into
the whole animal or plant to the destruction of its host.
Such beliefs, resting on the analogy of poisons and their
physiological consequences, are magical imaginations: the
taboo has the same character as a conditional curse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly, the prohibition of marriage within the Totem-clan,
if it originated (as I have supposed) with the fusion
of Totemism and Exogamy in the customs of various early
groups of men and women, is not based on Magic; but the
penalties for breaking the taboo are magical. Thus amongst
the Euahlayi and their neighbours men and women of the
Iguana clan cannot intermarry, though coming from different
parts of the country and without any traceable consanguinity;
because, if they did, their children, inasmuch as their ancestors
on both sides were the same animal, would “throw
back” to the form or attributes of the iguana.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> A grotesque
anticipation of scientific ideas.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable connexion between Totemism
and Magic occurs in those rites by which clansmen in several
parts of the world, but especially in Australia, believe themselves
able to influence their Totems: when these are edible,
to multiply them; when noxious, to drive away or destroy
them; or, as with the wind and rain, to control them for
the general good. Spencer and Gillen<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> give astonishing
descriptions of the rites of multiplication (or Intichiuma),
carefully prepared and regulated, including disguisings of
clansmen in the likeness of the Totems, drawings of the
Totems on the ground, dances, incantations and ceremonies,
sometimes representing traditional history—by which the
tribesmen discharge this function of theirs. They rely
chiefly on mimetic (exemplary) Magic which, by dramatising
some natural process, brings it into real operation.
In identifying themselves with the Totem, they exert their
imaginations to the utmost, and to this end may eat a little
of the Totem, at other times forbidden. This assumption
that by eating a little of any animal, plant or human being,
you become one with it, or acquire its qualities, or, further,
that two men by eating together of the same food become
allied (which is in a manner materially true, but absurdly
interpreted), is another of those notions simpler than, and
antecedent to, Magic, which provide a base for magical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
operations.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> These solemnities last for months, and are
carried out with conscientious diligence and earnestness:
the infatuation is profound and universal. Here, as at most
of the higher stages of culture, we find the most intense
emotions of which men are capable excited by participation
in communal imaginative exercises that have directly, in
relation to their expectations, absolutely no result. Indeed,
pre-occupation with vain employments tends to exclude all
ideas that might be useful, that might lead (<abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>) to the
increasing of food by the cultivation of plants or domestication
of animals. Sir James Frazer has pointed out that
a passage of the rites of the Grass-seed clan, in which grass-seeds
are scattered about upon the ground, might have led
to cultivation: but the mental state of the clan is unfavourable
to cool observation. As for animals, it is some excuse
for the backwardness of Australian culture that the Marsupialia
do not comprise a single species that would repay
domestication. Indirectly and undesignedly these performances
have very useful consequences: they annually
restore the unity of the tribe assembled from all parts for
the great occasion; promote mutual good-will and a spirit
of co-operation, for which they afford the chief opportunity;
maintain the social organisation and the tradition of customs
by increasing the influence of the Headmen, who have a
leading part in everything that happens, and on whose
authority all order and discipline depend; interrupt the
monotony of savage life with variety of interests; stimulate
ingenuity, and fill up the time, that might else be wasted in
idleness or quarrelling, with artistic and dramatic recreation.</p>

<p>Upon these rites for the multiplication and control of the
Totems, Sir James Frazer based his second hypothesis
concerning the origin of Totemism, namely, that it was a
system of co-operation amongst sections of a savage tribe
for the magical supply of food, etc.: the Emu clan multiplying
emus, the Kangaroo clan kangaroos, the Witchety-Grub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
clan witchety-grubs, and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> But he afterwards
reflected that such a design was beyond the conception of
savages. And, no doubt, as a plan thought out and deliberately
adopted as a whole, most ethnologists would
consider it above the capacity of Australian aborigines.
But if so—though not more difficult than the invention of
the Classificatory Marriage System—it shows what complex
arrangements, simulating design, may come into existence
by the growth of custom; for the clans certainly do co-operate
in the magical supply of food.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the origin of Totemism the
institution seems to have been utilised by some tribes in an
ambitious attempt to control all nature by grouping (on
very obscure principles, if on any) various classes of phenomena
with the Totems, so that one clan or another is
responsible for everything. Short of this, it is plainly necessary
to control the wind, rain, hail and lightning. The
control of an animal Totem is not always benevolent toward
the animals themselves. In the Kakadu tribe it is the duty
of the Mosquito clan to save the rest from mosquitoes; they
make imitation mosquitoes, dance and sing, and imagine
they are killing them.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> In North America similar beliefs
and practices have been found both for encouraging and for
discouraging the Totem, but occasionally and irregularly.
The Bird clan of the Omahas, when birds threatened the
crops, prevented their devastations by chewing corn and
spitting it about over the fields; when mosquitoes were
troublesome, the Wind people flapped blankets to raise a
wind and blow the pests away; when worms attacked the
crops, the Reptile clan (worms and reptiles are confused
in primitive Zoology) countermined their approaches by
pounding up some of them with a little corn into a soup and
eating it.<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> The most remarkable American rites for the
increase of food—the Buffalo-dances and Corn-festivals of
the Mandans—were not totemic, but carried out by the
whole tribe. The buffalo hunting-dance to bring the herd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
within reach, was continued, if necessary, for weeks—in
fact until the animals came; so that the Magic was always
effectual.</p>


<h3><a id="ch09_08"></a>§ 8. Totemism and Animism</h3>

<p>If the unity of clansmen with their Totem is very early
conceived of as consisting in having the same, or the same
sort of, soul, it is thenceforward essentially animistic. Yet
this idea seems only very slowly to have led to any sense of
dependence on the Totem as a spiritual power, or to any
expectation that it would help or succour the clansmen, or
(consequently) to the making of any appeal to it, except by
magical coercion. Perhaps the earliest way in which the
Totem was supposed to aid its clansmen was by omens;
as a Black Duck man of the Yuin tribe (West Australia)
thought that black ducks warned him against his enemies;
but this is more characteristic of guardian spirits than of
Clan-Totems. Occasionally in Australia we meet with
something like a prayer to a Totem. On the Tully River
(Queensland) we are told by Mr. W.&nbsp;E. Roth that before a
man goes to sleep, or on waking in the morning, he utters in
a low voice the name of the animal whose name he bears,
or which belongs to his group; and that then, if edible, he
will be successful in hunting it or, if dangerous, it will not
hurt him without warning.</p>

<p>Professor Durkheim has an elaborate theory of the growth
of divinities from Totems in Australia, especially in the
example of Bungil, the Eagle-Hawk, a great phratry name-animal
in several tribes.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> He is a persuasive writer, but
perverse and ingenious. Bungil receives neither prayer nor
sacrifice (these, indeed, in the author’s view are not necessary
to religion), and there is nothing to show that he differs from
the other glorified Headmen who are found in Australia.
The most plausible of these superior beings is Byamee of
the Euahlayi, who is not a Totem, but the source of Totems,
which are derived from different parts of his body. At
funerals prayers are addressed to him for the souls of the
dead; and, again, at the close of the Boorah (initiation rites)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
for long life, inasmuch as the tribesmen have kept his law.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
We are told that the nearest mission-station is a hundred
miles off, and recently established; but on reading further
that only those who have been initiated can go to Byamee’s
sky-camp, and that gross sinners are punished in the next
life in Eleanbah Wundah, a place dark but for fires,<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> we
cannot help reflecting that missionaries are not the only
channels of sound doctrine.</p>

<p>The most authentic example of the rise of a Totem to
something like divine rank is the Wollunqua, the great snake
of the Warramunga, which differs from other Totems in
being not a real animal but a mythological monster. It is
not approached with prayer or sacrifice; but is the object of
rites in part propitiatory, in part coercive, and is certainly
regarded with superstitious awe much as a demon might
be. To please the Wollunqua, the clan build a long mound
and draw its representation upon it; which, however, afterwards
meets with “savage destruction.” On approaching
Thapanerlu, the sacred pool where it lives, they whispered to
it “to remain quiet and do them no harm.”<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, funeral ceremonies, in Australia, to provide
the dead with necessaries, food, utensils, warmth—even
precautions against ghosts—come nearer to religious ideas
than anything connected with Totemism. Among the
Jupagalk (Victoria) a person when in great pain would call
on some dead friend to come and help him, to visit him in a
dream and teach a song against the evil magic that hurt
him.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>In Yam Island (Torres Straits) there is a cult of two
brothers, Maiou and Sigai, who are said to have come from
Australia. They have shrines within a fence; women and
uninitiated youths are not permitted to enter, and do not
know that Maiou is the crocodile (Kodal), and Sigai the
hammer-headed shark (Kursi); for they are always addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and spoken of by their names as heroes, and not by their
animal or Totem names. The shrines contain effigies made
of turtle-shell representing the animals; and under each
effigy is a stone in which the life or spirit of the Totem-hero
resides. The natives, in the north-west monsoon, danced
and sang before them for fine weather; and also on going to
war, praying: “O Totem Sigai and Totem Maiou, both of
you close the eyes of these men so that they cannot see us.”<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>
This is indisputably Religion; it is not, however, pure
Totemism, but apparently a fusion of hero-worship with
the Totemism of the heroes. Another hero of more recent
date, Quoiam, is worshipped in the neighbouring island of
Mabuaig. He came from North Queensland; and his house
and cairn are still shown on a hill-top. His Totem was the
shovel-nosed skate, but he has undergone no fusion with
that animal. We may be inclined to infer that the hero can
stand alone, whilst a Totem needs the alliance of a hero to
anthropomorphise it.</p>

<p>Such an inference is, on the whole, confirmed by the
state of religion in Fiji. There, amongst the coastal
tribes, Totemism is decadent and irregular; though even
on the coast of Viti Levu there are deities with animal
attributes, and especially with the power of changing
into animals; and the animal connected with a god must
not be eaten by people of the district where he is worshipped.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
In the mountainous interior Totemism still flourishes, and
animal-gods are worshipped which have been assumed to
have originated in Totems. Dr. Rivers tells us<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> that he
formerly assumed this, but is inclined to revise his opinion.
The Fijian Snake-god Ndengei was, according to tradition,
a man who came to the island from elsewhere; probably he
made a great impression and was apotheosised. His character
as a Snake-god may be derived from the snake’s having
been his Totem. Probably god-like beings in Fiji were in
many cases heroes, but a close relation with their Totem
endued them with something of the animal nature. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
evolution would not be simply from Totem to god, but from
hero and Totem together to god.”</p>

<p>Gods present in animals, sometimes in plants, were acknowledged
in Samoa, Tahiti, Hawaii, Tonga; and, in fact,
Polynesia is the region where, if anywhere, Totems contribute
largely to the divine population. Rivers will not
deny (<abbr>loc. cit.</abbr>) that direct evolution of gods from Totems
may have taken place; but he points out that in Samoa,
for example, the Octopus-god (Ole Fe’e) was, according to
tradition, brought to the island by a Fijian chief. Was
then the mollusc or the chief the root from which the god
grew up? In Savaii there were gods incarnate in men: one
in an actual man who was a cannibal propitiated with human
flesh; another, invisible to the people, though seen by
strangers as a handsome young man wearing a girdle of leaves,
was called the King of Fiji (Tuifiti). Other gods described
by Turner<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> are Ole alii Fiti (chief of Fiji), who was manifest
in an eel; and Tinalii (King of chiefs), who was associated
with the sea-eel, octopus, mullet, and the ends of banana
leaves. Fusion seems to have been common.</p>

<p>It must not, of course, be assumed that all animal gods
are Totems. Among the ways in which animal gods may have
arisen we cannot deny some place to Spencer’s hypothesis,
that heroes have sometimes been worshipped as animals
because they bore animal names; and, after their death,
the eponymous animals, ever present to men’s eyes, superseded
the heroes, and were connected with and transformed
their legends. It is also conceivable that a hero has been
worshipped in the form of an animal or plant, because he
had announced that, after death, he would be in such an
animal or plant; for at Ulawa (Solomon Isles) bananas were
<i lang="und" xml:lang="und">buto</i>, things that might not be eaten, approached or beheld
(according to Dr. Coddrington<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>), because an influential man
had prohibited the eating of them, saying that, after death,
he would be in the banana; and with so much influence
he might, in favourable circumstances, have become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Banana-god. And, again, in Professor Westermarck’s opinion,
“the common prevalence of animal worship is, no doubt,
due to the mysteriousness of the animal world; the most
uncanny of all creatures, the serpent, is also the one most
generally worshipped.”<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>But these considerations strengthen the probability that
a Totem may sometimes become a god; having the general
respect of the clan to begin with. Some Totems having been
deified with the assistance of heroes, others may perhaps be
elevated by the force of analogy; or, once the conception
of a spiritual being has been reached—chiefly (as we suppose)
by reflection on dreams—and animals and even inanimate
things have been thought to have spiritual doubles, if then
the Totem is conceived to have a spirit, and even the same
as the clansman’s soul, if it is appealed to for assistance, if
it sends omens, listens to prayer and accepts sacrifice, what
is it but a god?</p>

<p>In North America the Totem seems nowhere to have been
worshipped; and any tendency that may have existed to
propitiate it was diverted by the superior fascination of the
personal guardian-genius, to which sometimes costly sacrifices
were made and even self-mutilations; as among the
Mandans, who often cut off a finger to secure its favour.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
On the other hand, a class of spirits was recognised in the
“elder brother” of each species of animal (or of the most
interesting species—bear, deer, snake, etc.—all of the totemic
class), a being (in the words of an early missionary, 1634)
“who is as it were the principle and origin of all the individuals,”
and “marvellously great and powerful”:<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> it
watches over the species and avenges its wrongs. In North-West
America and throughout Siberia the Bear and the
Raven are objects of religious reverence; not, indeed, as
clan-totems, but for all men. Among the Gulf nations the
Yuchis are Totemists, and a youth at his initiation is put
under the care of his clan-totem, instead of a personal guardian-genius
as among the northern tribes; he looks for protection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
however, not to the living animals of the Totem species, but
to superior beings, like the “elder brothers” of the species.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
Similar to these must be the Beast-gods of the Zuni Indians,
to whom they offer a portion of all game, praying that they
will intercede for them with the Sun-Father. In South
America, too, the Patagonians and Araucanians teach that
each species of animal has a guardian spirit, who lives in a
cave, and that the Indians themselves at death go to live
with him. We can hardly doubt that in all these cases, the
spirit-animals are in some way connected with totemic
beliefs: if not gods, they are at least divine beings, and they
exemplify a noble sort of mysticism that is natural to the
Amerind imagination.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>Africa is the principal home of Zoolatry. The religion of
the Bantu nations of South Africa is, indeed, ancestor-worship;
and their serpent-cult seems to be an outgrowth
of ancestor-worship (for they think that their dead return as
serpents of various species according to rank); unless,
indeed, it has been diverted to such a subordinate place
from some more ancient superstition. In West Africa there
are many Beast-gods, especially the leopard, hyena, crocodile
and python. They do not, however, give much indication
of totemic origin; and Sir James Frazer observes that,
as the hereditary worship of animals in certain districts (as
of the hyena at Accra) was not totemic, nor need similar
practices have been so elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> Hence that the Egyptians
worshipped certain animals, and that in the district of any
animal’s worship it was not killed or eaten, cannot prove that
the worship was totemic, unless it be shown that Totemism
is the only road to Zoolatry; for, if there are other ways, any
animal that becomes divine will, naturally, not be killed or
eaten. On the other hand, that the Egyptians were not
Exogamists does not prove they were not Totemists; since
some known Totemists are not Exogamists. The natural
impression of a student who merely comes amongst other
things to Egyptian Religion is that Totemism was one of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
sources; but it is a subject on which, more strictly than on
most, only a few specialists can form a judgment.</p>

<p>On the whole, the contribution of Totemism to religion
seems to have been greatly exaggerated. Compared with the
influence of dead heroes and ancestors, or with the personification
of the greater manifestations of nature—Sky, Sun,
Thunder—it has been ineffective, falling short of the production
of high gods; or if, as in Polynesia, it seems sometimes
to have come near to that achievement, it may be
suspected that its success owed much to an alliance with
hero-worship.</p>

<br />MAGIC AND SCIENCE</h2>


<h3><a id="ch10_01"></a>§ 1. Their Common Ground</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not infrequently said that Science is derived from
Magic, and the tenet is strengthened by eminent names; nor
is it displeasing to some bystanders whose attitude toward
Science is one of imperfect sympathy; but it seems to me to
involve a misunderstanding of the matter. Magic and Science
have, indeed, some common ground; for both are products
of our poor human mind, which is sorely pestered in explaining
its experiences by the notion of “forces” that somehow
bring about events, and which cannot get on at all without
assuming uniformities of relation. Magic supposes constant
connexions of events due to the agency, force, influence or
virtue of charms, rites and spells; which connexions, however,
are found only to be tendencies of some events to excite
others, inasmuch as they may be frustrated by counteracting
charms, rites or spells. This reads like a caricature of scientific
ideas. Not long ago, too, “forces” had a considerable
vogue amongst scientists; and such mysteries as “vital force”
and “psychic force” are still to be met with. But it is plain
that we never know more than that under certain conditions a
change takes place; and when we try to explain the change by
analysing the conditions, we never find any “force” distinct
from the collocation and motion of bodies or particles. “Force”
may be technically and formally used in various propositions,
but the idea never contributes anything to the explanation of
events; whilst the fact that with many people it seems to do
so, often makes it a nuisance. That it seems to carry some
explanation with it is due to the continuous influence of Magic
which, though always the antithesis of Science, was yet for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
very many ages associated with Science. Magic is entirely
constituted by notions of force, sometimes violent, as in
the discharge of an enchanted spear; sometimes subtle, like
the efficacy of an opal; intangible, invisible, and operating
at a distance through space and time, like a witch’s spells
that eclipse the sun or moon. These forces have only a
one-sided relation to the workaday world; they meet with
no resistance from what we take to be the “properties of
matter,” such as weight and impenetrability; but are themselves
entirely exempt from natural law: what we call the
“real world” has no hold upon them; they live in a world of
their own. They are absolutely immeasurable; and hence
the causation, which is certainly implied in the notion of
their operation, is indefinite, and becomes vaguer and vaguer
as the magical system develops; and all this is the opposite
of what happens in the history of Science. In spite of having
a necessary common ground in the human mind, Magic and
Science are contrasted from the first, in their development
grow wider and wider apart, in their methods and ideas more
and more opposed. If either can be said to precede the
other, it is Science (at least, in its earliest and crudest form)
that precedes Magic.</p>

<p>We had better begin, however, by considering a third
something which is earlier than either of them, and which I
have called Common-sense: I mean the accumulation of
particular items of positive knowledge (which, as such, is
the first form of Science) acquired by primitive man, and in
less measure by the higher brutes: facts about cold and heat,
sunshine and rain, the powers of water and fire, the life of
trees and animals, the properties of wood and stone, and so
forth, which are unfailingly confirmed by further experience.
Examination of the life of savages discovers that this positive
knowledge of theirs amounts to a great deal, and that they are
able to use it “and reason not contemptibly.” From this
Common-sense Science and a good deal of Magic are differentiated,
and they expand at very unequal rates in opposite
directions. Each of them starts from it; but whilst Magic
rapidly distorts, perverts and mystifies it out of recognition
in innumerable imaginations, Science slowly connects its fragments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
together, corrects, defines and extends it, without ever
altering its original positive character. The difference between
Magic and Science lies (as we have seen) in the causes that
establish belief in them; in the character of their ideas—respectively,
incoherent and vague, coherent and definite;
and, as a consequence, in their respective falsity and truth.</p>


<h3><a id="ch10_02"></a>§ 2. The Differentiation</h3>

<p>Whilst Magic, amongst savage and barbarous people, is
practised more or less by almost everybody, it is especially
developed by the professional wizard, and in his art and
tradition it is most conveniently studied. The wizard, or
(at least) a leader amongst wizards, is a man of superior
ability, penetration and enterprise; liable to be misled by
a sanguine and ambitious temperament into extravagant
imaginations and impostures, but with much more real knowledge
than the rest of the tribe. He often takes pains to
increase his knowledge, for it is the true basis of his power:
“the power of the Angoqok,” says Mr. Turner, writing of
the Esquimo,<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> “has some basis in experienced weather-lore,
and knowledge of the habits of animals, by which he advises
hunters.” But this knowledge is often the starting-point of his
delusions, not altogether by any fault of his own, but as a
result of his attempts to apply knowledge to new cases without
any appreciation of the need of caution or of the conditions of
sound inference and of proof and disproof. He never knows
why he is right or why he is wrong. Hence, beside the modest
edifice of his real knowledge, he builds out in one direction
a few genuine additions warranted by sound inference and
observation; whilst in the other direction he raises, largely
by analogy, with the help of “sympathy” and spiritual
powers, a towering structure of imaginations, which throws his
little hut of Common-sense quite into the shade.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) For example, the wizard is often literally a medicine-man
or physician, and knows the use of certain drugs; and
he may discover other drugs and more uses for them, and in
that direction lies Pharmacology. But in the other direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
he adopts on altogether fanciful occasions a great many
other recipes that serve no purpose but charlatanry and
mystification. Pliny, much of whose <cite>Natural History</cite> is a
handbook of ancient medicine, describes hundreds of remedies
derived from animals, vegetables and minerals; and Burton<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
cites Galeottus as having enumerated 800 medicinal herbs
and other drugs. Some of these were good and are still in
use, but most were useless or worse than useless. The
difference between these two classes of drugs depended on a
difference of method in determining their uses: a difference
that existed but was not yet understood (namely), on the
one hand, proof by experience, giving in the smaller class the
rudiments of medical science; and, on the other hand,
acceptance on the strength of superficial likeness, or of
the doctrine of qualities, virtues and signatures, which made
the larger class essentially magical.</p>

<p>Thus all sorts of precious stones and metals were believed
to be medicinal, not because they had been known to cure
any disease, but because it seemed obvious in those days that
precious things must have all sorts of desirable effects by
some occult virtue. Gold, the most perfect of all substances
(according to the alchemists), must in particular be a propitious
and powerful restorative. So Chaucer says of his
Doctour of Phisik:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">“For gold in phisik is a cordial,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore he lovede gold in special.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">And throughout India at the present day gold is a trusty
item in any prescription. Belief in the virtue of precious
stones probably goes back to very early times; since we find
that in Australia crystals are not only magically powerful
but the great primary sources of Magic, by having which
inside him the wizard acquires and maintains his power.</p>

<p>With herbs, again, whilst the utility of some, such as
quinine or senna, was a matter of experience, others were
equally prized out of pure fancy. Dracunculus, a plant
spotted with various colours, like a viper’s skin, was supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
to be a remedy for all kinds of snake-stings.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> The Cherokees
gave their children a concoction of burs to strengthen their
memories; for as a bur will stick to anything, the mind of a
man with bur inside him will cling to all kinds of useful information.
The same Amerinds had other remedies which
illustrate the character of magical physic. They concocted
a vermifuge of the red fleshy stalks of chickweed, which somewhat
resemble worms, and therefore must have some influence
upon them; and they steeped in this concoction a flint
arrow-head, that its sharpness, communicated to the brew,
might cut the worms in pieces. Biliousness, marked by
the vomiting of yellow bile, was cured by four herbs—all
yellow in root, or stalk, or flower. To ward off smallpox
they ate the flesh of the buzzard: that bird being, in their
opinion, exempt from smallpox, because its foul stench keeps
the disease-spirit at a distance. To cure snake-bite, they
said, rub the place in the direction contrary to that in which
the snake coils itself (to the right); because this is the same as
uncoiling it.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> But here there seems to be some hiatus in the
thought, for how does uncoiling the snake counteract its
poison? One easily appreciates the exultation of the wizard
to whom this idea first revealed itself, and his contempt for
the dull process of working it out, when its place in the
harmony of things was self-evident.</p>

<p>In some of these cases we find the assumption (tacit with
primitive practitioners, but explicit in Mediæval Medicine)
that “like causes like”: the adhesiveness of the bur is
communicated to the memory, the sharpness of the flint arrow-point
to the vermifuge, the buzzard’s immunity from smallpox
to the eater of the buzzard. And this is intelligible: because,
first, there are many examples (superficially considered)
of like causing like, such as animal generation, the spread of
fire; hot things heat, and cold things cool, and so forth: and,
secondly, qualities such as stickiness and sharpness, are
thought of by savages as fine material, like curses and ghosts,
which may be transferred from one thing to another. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
in other cases it is assumed that “like cures like,” as chickweed
cures worms, and yellow herbs biliousness (as in Europe
turmeric was long believed to cure jaundice); and this is a
very different matter—equivalent to “like expels or annuls
like.” In ordinary experience, there seem to be no obvious
examples of it: but in primitive medical practice it is found
that fomentation reduces inflammation, rubbing with snow
is good for frost-bite, an emetic cures sickness, and castor
oil diarrhœa; and such may be the experiential ground of
these magico-medical fancies.</p>

<p>The power of herbs may depend upon rites observed at
their gathering: when a Cherokee wizard pulled up a plant for
medicine, he dropped a bead into the hole to compensate the
earth for the theft;<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> and when a Greek physician gathered
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Panaces Asclepion</i>, which was a remedy for all diseases,
he filled the hole with various kinds of grain by way of expiation.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
In employing medicinal herbs it is also important to
remember <em>when</em> they should be procured, as on the eve of
the summer solstice, at the new or the full moon, or at the
turn of the tide; <em>by whom</em>—a child or a virgin; and <em>where</em>—on
a mountain-top or at a grave. Hierabotane was so potent
that whoever rubbed himself with it obtained whatever he
desired; and in gathering it, you first offered honey to the
earth in expiation, then traced a circle around it with iron,
and—taking care that neither sun nor moon should shine
upon it—at the rising of the Dog Star, you pulled it up with
the left hand, and dried separately in the shade the root, the
stem and the leaves.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Indeed the conditions under which a
drug can be legitimately obtained so as to ensure its efficacy,
may be so numerous, minute and exigent as to make the
satisfying of them almost impossible; so we need not wonder
if the remedy sometimes fails. Prescriptions often include
the flesh or juices of dead bodies, or their pounded bones,
or other foul and repulsive ingredients related to Black
Magic—much trusted, and still traditional in some strata
of this country, where the belief is inexpugnable that medicine,
the nastier it is, is the more efficacious.</p>

<p>If any one wonders how such prescriptions can have held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
their ground for ages, it was because patients did not always
die. Recovery was credited to the drastic medicine, and
death to evil Magic; and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</i>, that
staunch ally of honest physic, was sometimes too strong for
the wizard’s whole pharmacopœia.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Again, the wizard is a surgeon, and knows something
of the construction and working of the human body, and this
is the beginning of Anatomy and Physiology. He was especially
well informed in these matters in such a country as Fiji,
where he had access to two great sources of anatomical
knowledge—frequent wars and cannibalism. He also knows
certain ways of treating wounds and other lesions, such as
bandages, ligatures, splints, slings, massage and fomentations,
which all admit of rational development and have been continuously
practised to this day. Could he be content to abide
by the facts, all might be well; but he is tempted to extend his
methods in various directions to cases which, on very slight
grounds, he believes to be similar. The best known example
of the erroneous extension by analogy of a sound method is
the sucking-cure. It is, or has been, practised all over the
world, and obviously rests on the proved utility of suction in
extracting from the flesh thorns or poisons. In Australia
snake-bite is sometimes cured by sucking the wound and
rinsing the mouth with water.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> But the operation is gradually
applied to other cases until, whatever pain you suffer, it is
attributed to something like poison, or a thorn (or, later, a
spirit), that has got inside you, though by an invisible wound,
and may be sucked out. The wizard, accordingly, undertakes
to suck it out, and he sometimes exhibits it to you—a piece
of wood or bone, which he brought to your bedside in his
waistband. Sometimes a medicine-man enjoys great suctorial
powers by having a lizard in his own body.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>For getting a foreign body out of a man a method alternative
to suction is pressure. Mr. Howitt<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> reports a remarkable
prescription for curing headache. Cut out of the ground a
circular turf, place the sufferer’s head in the hole and the turf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
upon his head; then sit or stand upon it. He may presently
declare that he feels relief; but perhaps he only desires it.
It is a fact that a patient sometimes feels better after such
treatment, though the cause of his pain was nothing that could
possibly yield to suction or pressure: that is to say, his mind
yields to suggestion. But not all savages are equally suggestible,
any more than we are. Dr. Coddrington says<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> that,
in Pentecost Island, witches profess to cure pain with a leaf-poultice,
and in taking it off to remove with it the cause
of pain, perhaps a snake or a lizard. “But,” said a native,
“no one sees the things but the woman, and the pain
remains”—one of those troublesome sceptics! Yet it is
possible that had he just undergone the operation, he would
not have denied that the pain was better. There is a state
of mind between suggestibility and sane judgment, namely,
assentation: unwillingness or unreadiness to form or state
one’s own opinion, and, consequently, an appearance of
acquiescing in another’s assertion. There is confusion and
conflict, from which assent is the easiest relief. This state
of mind for the immediate purpose of medicine-man or
orator may serve as well as suggestibility; but may soon pass
off when the patient recovers his faculties, and should be
distinguished from the suggestibility that takes a relatively
permanent impression from the pretensions of a mountebank.
The power of suggestion, however, is one of the facts that
the wizard has observed, and he counts upon its aid. He has
also learnt to practise hypnotism; and seeing how mysterious
these things have been to the most enlightened moderns,
we need not wonder that he employs them in magical therapeutics—dancing,
drumming, shouting to overpower his
patient and to incite himself to put forth his utmost energy.
Nowhere, probably, in the whole range of his art, is the difference
between Reality and Magic so obscure to himself.</p>

<p>The wizard, then, acquired in his medical functions (and
in others) a certain empirical knowledge of some obscure facts
in Psychology, and this knowledge persisted in his profession
in shady quarters to our own time; but with the growth of
positive Science, its mysteriousness was mistaken for quackery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
until quite recently, when the facts forced themselves on
the attention of some men, who needed great courage to
confess their conviction. A crude Physiological Psychology,
too, resulted from savage observation of a connexion between
the agitations of body and mind. Very early sundry mental
powers—skill, courage, affection—are located in special
parts of the body—the heart, spleen, kidneys, bowels—as
they still are in popular language. Apart from the bare
observation that the bowels and heart are disturbed during
emotion (which is true and important), these doctrines are not
Science; nor are they exactly Magic, but belong to the region
of ideas ancillary to Magic—ideas of qualities as material
things. The savage, always eager to apply his supposed
knowledge to practice, utilises his Physiological Psychology
for the improvement of his mind, and misses no opportunity
to make a meal upon an enemy’s (or perhaps a relative’s)
heart or spleen or kidney or tongue or eye, in order to
appropriate the quality for which the deceased had been
conspicuous.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Savages (as we have seen in the chapter on Omens)
are familiar with a great many natural signs by which to
judge of things not now present, but that have happened, or
are about to happen. Every hunter must have a great stock
of such knowledge, inasmuch as the pursuit of game entirely
depends upon it. This knowledge of natural signs is, on
the one hand, a genuine contribution to Natural History; it
increases, is handed down from generation to generation, and
forms the nucleus of Botany and Zoology. But, on the other
hand, there is reared upon it, under the influence of hope
and fear, the belief in Omens that give warning of good or ill
success in all the affairs of life. Omens, at first merely
signs mysteriously connected with events, are later regarded
as the sendings of spirits or gods, whose oracles forecast
the fate of heroes and nations. At first, perhaps, the wizard
may do no more than other tribesmen to promote this particular
superstition; but it is he who works out the great art
of Divination, without which Omens would have been a
matter of much less consequence.</p>

<p>The most famous branch of Divination, namely, Astrology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
was the invention of a comparatively late age, and it was,
of course, long preceded by the discovery of the rudiments of
Astronomy as part of the common sense of agriculture: some
knowledge of the regularity of the motions of the sun and moon
and of the constancy of the stars in contrast with the planets.
This is plainly presupposed by the comprehensive system of
predictions based on sympathetic Magic, arbitrary assumptions
and fanciful analogies which, for the last four or five
thousand years, has promised to disclose to any mother the
career of her infant, or to any monarch the future of his
kingdom. But what now seems fanciful or arbitrary once
seemed reasonable. The sun manifestly rules all things;
the waxing and waning of the moon must strengthen and
weaken all things; the signs of the Zodiac are certainly
connected with the seasons; the planets partake of the
nature of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> If there are gods they must, as the Stoics
argued, have some way of communicating with men; and
what way can be more congruous with their nature than by
writing on the face of the heavens? But generally the ideas
of Astrology were magical rather than animistic. Having
determined the powers and dispositions of the heavenly
bodies, let us consider only what must necessarily follow from
their influences in conjunction or opposition and various
relations in trine, quartile and sextile. Thus they dreamed
and speculated, but at the same time made many exact
observations on the sky. And so Astronomy made some
progress in spite of Magic.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) More widely prevalent than Astrology and far more
ancient is the art of controlling the weather, especially rain;
for rain, from its uncertainty in many countries and its
indispensableness, is a matter of deeper interest and anxiety
than even the sun himself. “Rain-making,” as it is called,
common in Australia and other regions of lowly culture,
survives when society has risen to higher levels, becomes the
function of the most eminent wizards or priests, sometimes
the duty of kings, and is not extinct amongst ourselves.
But from what knowledge of fact or common sense can “rain-making”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
be derived? I conjecture it was from facts observed
in the behaviour of fire.</p>

<p>The making of fire was the first great chemical experiment
and the foundation of all Chemistry. Having made fire, the
most wonderful of all achievements, there would be little
excuse for astonishment if men had then thought they could
also make rain; but probably they never thought so. It
seems to me a misconception of rain-rites to describe them
as endeavours to “make” rain; for they plainly aim not at
making, but at inducing, instigating or propagating it. The
Swazies, we are told explicitly, try to procure rain by throwing
water high into the air, expecting that the falling drops will
stimulate the clouds in sympathy with them.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Savages may
be said to “make” fire; for until they rub their sticks, or
knock their flints together, it does not exist. But in the
so-called “making” of rain there is nearly always some water
to begin with; and the essence of a rain-rite is the splashing
of water into the air, or the pouring of it out, sometimes
on a particular stone, or on a particular person, with many
variations. In rare instances the water has been forgotten:
the Kurnai, instead of water, let blood, and throw down into
the air for clouds; but in another rite they fill their mouths
with water and squirt it out in one direction or another
(according to the clan) and sing a spell: to stop the rain they
throw up fire-sticks.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> Those who practise such rites hope
that the spilling of a little water will bring on a great downfall
or outpouring of water, namely, rain; and this agrees with
the fact that a wizard will not operate except when the rainy
season approaches. Now this inducing of much by little is
not, indeed, analogous to the <em>making</em> of fire; but it is analogous
to the spread or propagation of fire; when, having produced
a few sparks, these spread through tinder to the firewood,
and thence a conflagration may be communicated to the
prairie or to the forest. My conjecture is, then, that not
the making (which is never attempted) but the inducing,
or propagation of rain is based on the analogy of the propagation
of fire, and belongs to the class of exemplary or incentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
rites; which are to be understood not as intending
the direct causation of events, but rather as instigating
Nature to bring it about: the class described in <a href="#ch04_08">Chap. <abbr class="no-it" title="4">IV.</abbr>
§ 8</a>, such as the furthering of crops by fertility-rites, or the
ensuring of successful hunting or warfare by a dramatic
dance.</p>

<p>Rain-rites being very apt to fail of their purpose, the
wizard is in danger of losing his reputation, or of some worse
fate. His attention is, therefore, drawn to the signs of the
weather, the character and course of the seasons, the connexion
of rain with the aspect of the sky and direction of the
wind; so that he learns to operate for rain only when rain
may reasonably be expected. He has then laid out the
rudiments of Meteorology, but by observation, not by hocus-pocus.</p>


<h3><a id="ch10_03"></a>§ 3. Why Magic seems to be the Source of Science</h3>

<p>In no case, then, is Science derived from Magic, but Science
on the one hand and Magic on the other are differentiated
from Common-sense,<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> and Science is much nearer akin to
Common-sense than Magic is, being of the same substance
and only formally different. And in that sense it is earlier
than Magic, and sometimes formally earlier, as in the case of
Astronomy and Astrology. The illusion that Magic is the
earlier is due to the misinterpretation of two facts: (<i>a</i>) Magic
and Science are, for the most part and during many ages,
worked out by the same men—magicians or priests; and all
that they do is mistaken for Magic, even by themselves. And
(<i>b</i>) Magic in most of its branches undergoes immense development,
whilst the Sciences remain rudimentary; grows old and
even decrepit, whilst they are still in infancy; so that, on first
emerging into public notice, they seem to issue from the matrix
of Magic.</p>

<p>The reasons for the relative backwardness of Science,
again, are chiefly three: (<i>a</i>) For ages it is in the hands of
wizards who, though highly valuing knowledge, are mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
eager for power and prophecy. It is true that Science gives
power, and the hope of power is a reasonable incentive to
the study of Science; but it must be a remote incentive, in
the actual work of research rigorously excluded. There,
unless truth is the sole end in view, the procedure will not
be clean, will be confined to immediate utility. But this is a
recent discovery. The wizard has no such ideas: he is
governed by his desires and traditions. Hence for verification
he is content with coincidences; negative instances he neglects,
or regards failure merely as an occasion for excuses. He
accepts connexions of events remote in space and time, and is
very slow to see the necessity of connecting events in the
closest possible sequence. Moreover, having no understanding
even of the facts he knows (such as the making of fire), the
mysteriousness of any relation of events constitutes no objection
to his acceptance of it; as the magical side of his practice
grows, so does its mystery; until at last mysteriousness
is a strong recommendation, and becomes a character of
the apperceptive mass that assimilates and confirms all
magical beliefs. This state of mind always offers strong
resistance to positive explanation.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Another reason of the backwardness of Science is the
slow elucidation of the idea of Causation—long obscured by
the impressiveness of coincidence and by fallacious imaginations
of magical and spiritual forces: a process still incomplete.
Until this idea had made considerable progress in definiteness
(in antiquity, say, with Archimedes, and in modern times with
Galileo), it was impossible that the indispensableness of
analysis and elimination should be understood, that absolute
respect should be felt for negative instances and that any gap
in a series of events should always be regarded as an instant
problem. And, finally (<i>c</i>), for scientific progress it was
necessary that reasoning by analogy should be abandoned,
and a methodology discovered of parallel and equational
reasoning, with the apparatus that makes exact investigation
possible.</p>

<p>As the Sciences grow in comprehensiveness, precision
and solidarity, they constitute their own apperceptive mass,
assimilation with which is the supreme test of all relevant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
beliefs; and this, together with a methodology that has
become a habit of mind, tends to establish a social atmosphere
in which Magic is no longer thinkable. Exact habits of
thought in commerce and industry contribute greatly to this
result. So we are tempted to ridicule our benighted predecessors;
but a study of the conditions of their life shows that
darkness was no more their fault than illumination is our
merit.</p>

<p>The nearest approach that can be truthfully made to
the position that Science is derived from Magic, is to say
that the scientist is derived from the wizard (or wizard-priest),
on that side of his activity in which he relied upon
fragments of positive knowledge; but this was, in nature,
always opposed to his Magic. In the course of thousands of
years some men grew more interested in the positive than
in the magical side of their profession, and became scientists;
whilst others adhered to the fanciful and mystical. It is
remarkable that, as sceptics occur in the most unsuspected
quarters, so pure scientists may sometimes be found as an
institution in barbarous or even savage communities. In
a Bantu tribe there is a class of doctors that claim no powers
by the aid of spirits or Magic, but without any ceremony
dispense a few well-known drugs—aloes, nux vomica, castor-oil,
fern-root, rhubarb, and the bark of various trees, purgative
or emetic.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> The Kanyahs of Borneo have a weather-prophet
to determine the right time for sowing; he is not expected
to cultivate padi, but is supplied with it by the rest of the
village. Not knowing how many days there are in a year,
and finding that the seasons do not correspond with any
certain number of lunar months, he depends entirely upon
observation of the altitude of the sun by means of an upright
pole, whose upper end is carved into a human figure.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Except
the carving on his pole, there is nothing to indicate that either
Magic or Animism perturbs the method of this Astronomer
Royal. Hence the adventure, though most wonderful,
is not unexampled in a humbler world, by which eminent
citizens amongst the Greek laity, with minds almost free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Magic and Animism, established for ever Philosophy and the
Sciences as liberal studies.</p>


<h3><a id="ch10_04"></a>§ 4. Animism and Science</h3>

<p>Animism is opposed to Science, as well as to Magic,<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> by
its rejection of uniformity. A spirit, indeed, has some
character (though it may be very faintly marked); for he is,
or is assimilated to, a human ghost. But although he is
supposed to have reasons or motives for his actions, they
are often unintelligible. Until he is brought under the
control of magical rites and formulæ, he may reject offerings
and prayers, as if by pure caprice or free-will. His interventions
are incalculable. Hence he may be the unseen
agent in anything that happens; and the habit is formed
of putting upon him, or one of his kind, every occurrence
whose cause is not obvious: diseases, deaths, storms, droughts,
noises in the forest, unusual behaviour of animals. A spirit-being
with its body of soul-stuff capable of taking any shape,
a material thing exerting mechanical power, there is nothing
that may not be imputed to it. But being entirely imaginary,
its supposed agency can only satisfy the imagination by
the assimilation of each intervention by the animistic apperceptive
mass. It is never seen or known to do any one of
the actions attributed to it; for the understanding, based on
perception and the classification and analysis of perceptions,
it is nothing. Moreover, so far as the actions of a spirit
are of free-will, or motiveless, or pure caprice, there is no
distinct imagination of even a spiritual cause. When a
man, suffering from disease, or hearing an unfamiliar noise,
refers it to a spirit, there is usually nothing in his mind but
the word of vague meaning and a feeling of awe, wonder,
or dread. He gets no further in the understanding of the
fact, and curiosity is paralysed. To say “a spirit did it”
becomes, therefore, a means of avoiding the labour of explanation;
it is a good example of the “principle of least
effort.” But in another direction his wits may get to work.
He is full of fear, and objectless fear must invent a danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
which is easily done by supposing that the spirit has been
actuated by wrath. Then something must have been done
to enrage him: a taboo has been broken, his rites have
been neglected, sin has been committed—according to the
customary ideas of the tribe. There must be lustration, propitiation,
expiation, perhaps with horrible cruelty. Again,
then, shall we say the man has been diverted from the important
inquiry into the causes of disease or drought? But
this is laughable: how can he set about such a task? It
is the tragedy of the world that for thousands of years the
speculative powers of man—of some men—expanded without
any power, except in the classical age, of discriminating sense
from nonsense. Therefore, looking back, we see everywhere
else superstition and the kingdom of darkness.</p>

<p>Animism can never have directly enriched Science with
a single natural law; but, indirectly, it has instigated many
investigations. With the development of Religion, the
building of temples and the regulation of sacrifices and
festivals according to their seasons, necessitated at least
the empirical study of Geometry, Arithmetic and Astronomy;
and the preservation of the ancient language of the sacred
formulæ of ritual required a knowledge of prosody, phonetics
and grammar. For thousands of years erudition was confined
to the priestly orders. They also practised, or were the
chief patrons of, all the fine arts, Architecture, Sculpture,
Painting, Music and Poetry; and by their connexion with
government they left in Egypt and Assyria, in monuments
and inscriptions, History, or the materials of History. Indirectly,
the progress of mental culture, both in learning and
in æsthetics, has depended almost entirely on the development
of Animism; and this in turn has depended on the aid which
Animism gave to government and to the extension of law and
order, however imperfect, over wide regions of the earth.
This is the fundamental utility which, first, Magic and,
afterwards, Animism subserve, and for the sake of which—unconsciously,
of course—they arise and prevail. Mankind
has been subdued through imagination; because the peoples
that had the cast of imagination requisite for their political
organisation and co-operation had an advantage over others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>We must qualify this by observing that other imaginations,
such as devotion to the Family and Patriotism, with a much
surer hold than Animism has upon experience, have had a
great and growing influence upon the solidarity and civilisation
of some branches of the human race, especially the
Nordic.</p>

<p>Philosophy has derived from Animism most of her problems—free-will
and predestination, final causes, creation and
miracles, emanation and intuition, idealism and materialism,
immortality, the being and attributes of God, eternity, infinity—in
some of which, indeed, magical ideas are deeply concerned:
all of them the exercise of the most eminent minds,
exercise so delightful and so disappointing. Considering
their source, we cannot wonder that these problems remain
problems, and that philosophical discussion has, of late years,
turned from them to questions concerning the theory of
knowledge.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>A student of human origins is under no obligation to
predict the future. Fortunately: for several considerations
make the task appear altogether impossible. Of these I will
mention three: (<i>a</i>) Whereas nations have hitherto submitted
to, and enforced, law and order, and undertaken costly works
of utility or splendour, in large measure under the influence
of animistic illusions, it is now everywhere noticeable in
the more civilised countries, that these illusions are being
dissipated, and it is very difficult to judge how people will
behave when they are gone. It is, indeed, true that our
ordinary working life has always depended chiefly on common
sense, a knowledge of facts within the range of ordinary
experience and memory. Animistic or magical rites and ceremonies
associated with the working-life may have increased
the confidence and encouraged the co-operation of labourers,
but were not indispensable; although the association of Magic
with industry seems sometimes to have become so close, that
to forget the Magic was to destroy the industry. When, however,
we turn to those conditions of social life that are beyond
the purview of common sense, such as the preservation of
tribal tradition and solidarity, and future prosperity, loyalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to the king and obedience to his officers, it is plain that
something else than common sense was needed to reinforce
the interest of the whole against the tendency of the individual’s
self-assertion to overcome his social dispositions,
and that this control was found chiefly in Religion. It is also
true that at present, whilst some beliefs concerning supernatural
things are being lost, others are being resuscitated;
but the lapsing beliefs are noble and venerable and have
exerted great public power and authority; whilst those now
eagerly propagated, are the raw infatuation of quacks, on
a level with the Animism of an Australian medicine-man and,
indeed, much inferior to his, as having no moral influence or
authority. What must come of this is so dubious, as to
discourage one about the future of the world.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Reflection on the levity with which imagination-beliefs
are let slip and lost, or received and adopted, upon
no evidence either way, from mere shallowness of soul, brings
forward a second consideration that makes the future impredictable,
namely, the low average development of mankind
in both intellect and character. This is the consequence of
our having depended, probably from the very beginning, on
leaders. A pack or tribe needed enough variability to produce
able leaders and enough average ability to follow and support
them in a crowd. Natural Selection, therefore, has operated
first in producing variability; and all tribes, even the lowest,
produce relatively eminent men. The average intelligence
or ability of the crowd, in which individuality is liable to
be lost, is much less important. The result is that each
nation has its military affairs, organisation of industry,
science, invention, literature and art provided for it by a
small number of citizens; the rest fill the ranks, and learn
what they are taught. Thus arranged, the leading nations
have of late years made wonderful progress in science and in
everything that can be done by machinery; but there is no
reason to suppose that anything has been done towards raising
the average intelligence and character; and in default of that,
in my judgment, nothing has been done to advance civilisation.
The world is no safer against war, revolution, demagogy,
despotism, degeneration. The greatest improvements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
have been made in means of destruction; next we may
put the invention of flying machines; and their chief use
has been destruction. Destruction now pauses, not because
the antagonists are satiated; they are only exhausted; and
there is more hatred in the world than was ever known before.
How then shall we judge of things to come?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Speaking of the average man, we usually think of the
European and North American average; but in considering
what changes may be expected in the world, the people of
India (800,000,000), China (350,000,000), and the millions of
the rest of Asia, the Eastern Archipelago, Africa and South
America cannot be left out; and to include them does not
raise the average. What will be their contribution to
history? There are two rational proposals for raising the
average, namely, eugenics and deliberate elimination of the
unfit; and there are 1,600,000,000 on whom to operate.</p>

<p>Any one who anxiously desires to foresee the future of
our race is in a position to sympathise with the ancients.
Go, inquire at Delphi or Dodona; or sleep in Stonehenge, or
at the tomb of Merlin, or by the barrows at Upsala, and dream
of things to come; or consult the stars, cast the nativity of
Lycopithecus, and read in heaven the fate of his posterity.
If these methods are not very hopeful, any one of them is as
good as guessing. The only safe reflection is that he who
lives longest will see most.</p>

<p>Estimated
duration of the
Cainozoic Period,
assuming that
the thickness of
the deposits is
about 63,000 feet,
and that deposits
accumulate at
the rate of 1 foot
in 100 years.
Drawn to the
scale of 1 mm.
to 100,000 years.
The estimate is
given and explained
by Prof.
Sollas in the
<cite>Quarterly Journal
of the Geological
Society</cite>, LXV.
(1909). The
“tree” is based
on that given
by Dr. A. Keith
in <cite>The Antiquity
of Man</cite>, p. 509.</p>

<p>If we suppose the differentiation of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hominidæ</i> to have begun
before the close of the Oligocene, about (say) 3,500,000 years are
allowed for the evolution of the existing species of Man. All these
reckonings are provisional.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> That Man was from the first a hunter has been suggested by several
authors; but the consequences of the assumption have never (as far
as I know) been worked out. A.&nbsp;R. Wallace, in <cite>Darwinism</cite> (p. 459),
has the following passage: “The anthropoid apes, as well as most
of the monkey tribe, are essentially arboreal in their structure, whereas
the great distinctive character of man is his special adaptation to
terrestrial locomotion. We can hardly suppose, therefore, that he
originated in a forest region, where fruits to be obtained by climbing
are the chief vegetable food. It is more probable that he began his
existence on the open plains on high plateaux of the temperate or subtropical
zone, where the seeds of indigenous cereals, numerous herbivora,
rodents, game-birds, with fishes and molluscs in the lakes and
rivers and seas supplied him with an abundance of varied food. In
such a region he would develop skill as a hunter, trapper or fisherman,
and later as a herdsman and cultivator—a succession of which we find
indications in the palæolithic and neolithic races of Europe.”</p>

<p>Prof. MacBride, in his popular introduction to <cite>Zoology</cite> (p. 84), also
traces the specialisation of Man to the hunting life.</p>

<p>My friend Mr. Thomas Whittaker has sent me the following extract
from Comte’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Politique Positive</cite>, I. pp. 604-5: “L’obligation de se
nourrir d’une proie qu’il faut atteindre et vaincre, perfectionne à la
fois tous les attributs animaux, tant intérieurs qu’extérieurs. Son
influence envers les sens et les muscles est trop évidente pour exiger
ici aucun examen. Par sa réaction habituelle sur les plus hautes
fonctions du cerveau, elle développe également l’intelligence et l’activité,
dont le premier essor lui est toujours dû, même chez notre espèce. A
tous ces tîtres, cette nécessité modifie aussi les races qui en sont victimes,
d’après les efforts moins énergiques, mais plus continus, qu’elle y
provoque pour leur défense. Dans les deux cas, et surtout quant à
l’attaque, elle détermine même les prémières habitudes de co-opération
active, au moins temporaire. Bornées à la simple famille chez les
espèces insociables, ces ligues peuvent ailleurs embrasser quelquefois
de nombreuses troupes. Ainsi commencent, parmi les animaux, des
impulsions et des aptitudes qui ne pouvaient se développer que d’après
la continuité propre à la race la plus sociable et la plus intelligente.
Enfin, la condition carnassière doit aussi être appreciée dans sa réaction
organique. Une plus forte excitation, une digestion moins laborieuse
et plus rapide, une assimilation plus complète produisant un sang plus
stimulant: telles sont ses propriétés physiologiques. Toutes concourent
à développer les fonctions supérieures, soit en augmentant l’énergie
de leurs organes, soit en procurant plus de temps pour leur exercice.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> This view is not opposed to the suggestion I have somewhere
seen that the collecting activities of women, whilst men hunted, may,
at some stage, have led to property and domestication of plants and
animals. Again, the pastoral and agricultural states are not necessarily
successive: it depends upon local conditions. For an excellent
survey of the gradual rise of primitive culture and the difficulties it
encountered, see H. Spencer’s <cite>Industrial Institutions, Principles of
Sociology</cite>, Vol. III.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> It is certainly believed by fox-hunters that a fox feeds his vixen
when she is occupied with their family, and that “if the vixen is killed
he will bring up the family by himself.”—Thomas F. Dale, <cite>The Fox</cite>,
pp. 12, 13.</p>

<p>Nothing incredible in this—nor of wolves. Can the vixen provide for
herself and litter alone? If not, the dog must do it: else there could
be no foxes or wolves.</p>

<p>However, de Canteleu denies that the he-wolf takes any part in rearing
the young (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Chasse du Loup</cite>, p. 30).</p>

assuming that Man became a hunter for the sake of the excitement
such a life afforded, goes on (p. 23): “A little later the advantages of
neighbourliness were borne in on him, largely for the sake of the greater
ease wherewith the animals of the chase could be captured by their
combined efforts; but this begat comradeship and some of the graces
that follow therefrom.”</p>

this can only happen either where the belief in charms already exists

<p><a name="Footnote_120" id="Footnote_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> It has been thought strange that such a thing as a whirlwind may
excite in the savage either fear or anger. To explain this we must
consider the nature of wonder: it is an imaginative expansion of
surprise, temporary paralysis of the imagination, with emotional disturbance,
but no progressive instinct of its own. It either subsides
helplessly, or gives place to curiosity, or passes into some other emotion
that is connected with an instinct. Accordingly, it usually passes into
curiosity or else fear, but sometimes into anger: which of these emotions
shall be aroused depends, partly, upon the character of the person who
wonders, partly, upon circumstances.</p>

magic is probably older than the belief in spirits.” In the same note,
a passage in Hegel’s <cite>Philosophy of Religion</cite> is referred to as anticipating
the doctrine of the priority of Magic to Religion. The passage, as
translated in an appendix (pp. 423-6), shows, however, no conception
of Magic as akin to natural law, as it is described in several passages
of <cite>The Golden Bough</cite>, but treats it as a belief in any human being “as
the ruling power over nature in virtue of his own will.” This is rather
an anticipation of Prof. Wundt’s doctrine concerning Sorcery; which
Hegel seems not to have distinguished from Magic. I need hardly
add that a belief in any human being as the ruling power over nature
in virtue of his own will has never been discovered in any part of the
world.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_320" id="Footnote_320"></a><a href="#FNanchor_320"><span class="label">[320]</span></a> In a paper on <cite>Leopard Men of the Naga Hills</cite>, read at a meeting
of the R.A.I. (December 9, 1919), Mr. J.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;H. Hutton reported that
such men do not change into leopards; but sometimes their souls
involuntarily pass into them. If the leopard be injured or killed he
whose soul was in it suffers or dies—when he hears of it. Such men
are not feared, because their leopards do very little harm.</p>

<p>For this reason (I suppose) the belief is not exploited by wizards,
who have no use for innocent superstition, and it remains pure folklore.
There may not be any connexion between this animistic doctrine
of human souls possessing animals and the magical doctrine of shape-changing.
If they are connected, it is easy to see that in a certain
atmosphere of popular philosophy, if shape-changing were believed in,
the possession theory might be accepted as the true explanation upon
merely being proposed. Indeed, it would make intelligible such a
case as this: a man’s leopard is seen on the skirts of the village; but
he himself is known to be in his hut.</p>

<p>Animistic explanation does not always follow culture: Europe
adheres to shape-changing. Yet in the <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Volsung Saga</cite> the superstition
is already degenerate: Sigmund and his son change into wolves by
putting on wolf-skins belonging to two were-wolves whom they find
asleep. This is a rationalisation—disguise as a step toward change.
An earlier step is to say a man who would change must put on a belt
of wolf-skin.</p>

to the scheme <em>If A, then B</em>; and it is conceivable that, with strict
thinking, a belief in an Omen may give rise to a magical practice.
“For,” says Lord Avebury, “granted that the fall of a stick certainly
preludes that of the person it represents, it follows that by upsetting
the stick his death can be caused” (<cite>Origin of Civilisation</cite>, p. 166).
I do not see why such an inference should not be drawn, but can give
no example of it. The possibility shows how much community there
is between Magic and the lore of Omens; but as to this particular
case, the magical cast of mind is already implied in the original setting
up of the stick whose fall should prelude that of a given individual.</p>

the greatest spells and oracles are versified) the poet is inspired. In
Australia poets are sometimes carried by ghosts into skyland, where
they learn songs and dances. Some compose awake; but the belief
prevails that they are inspired in dreams by dead and kindred spirits.
Their songs travel far amongst tribes that no longer understand the
language. (Howitt, <cite>Native Tribes of South-East Australia</cite>, pp. 389
and 413.) Similarly in Fiji (<cite>Fiji and the Fijians</cite>, p. 98). “The poem
is too wonderful for me”—such is the poet’s humility; “it was made
by the gods”—such is his arrogance.</p>

wizards with renewed entrails communicate with supernatural beings,
interpret dreams and discover murderers; but they also recognise
spiritual communication with ordinary men in visions; not ordinary
dreams, which are mere fancies, but those that are repeated; and these
come from Kutchi, an evil spirit (Howitt, <abbr>op. cit.</abbr>, p. 358). We may be
sure the Greeks were mistaken in supposing that it was Amphiaraus
who instituted divination by dreams.</p>

by other wizards, are essential to his profession, and if they leave him
his power is lost. “It is the possession of these stones which gives
his virtue to the medicine-man” (Spencer and Gillen, <cite>Northern Tribes
of Central Australia</cite>, p. 480 note). John Mathew says that, according
to the belief of the Kabi (Queensland): “A man’s power in the occult
art would appear to be proportioned to his vitality, and the degree
of vitality which he possessed depended upon the number of sacred
pebbles and the quantity of <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">yurru</i> (rope) which he carried within him”
(<cite>Eagle-hawk and Crow</cite>, p. 143). “Rope” was the property of the
higher grade of medicine-men (substitute for snakes?), who had obtained
it from the Rainbow in exchange for some of their pebbles.
Certain pebbles, especially crystals, are independent magic-powers
throughout Australasia and elsewhere, probably of much older repute
than the profession of wizardry; and the wizard gets his personal
power by having them inside him. Similarly, Jounod describes Bantu
wizards as “endowed with magical power, or rather possessing enchanted
drugs” (<cite>Life of a South African Tribe</cite>, p. 293): whereas we
are often told that the occult art begins with the extraordinary personality
of the wizard.</p>

reprint of an earlier essay. A later definition (IV. p. 3) runs:
“Totemism is an intimate relation which is supposed to exist between
a group of kindred people on the one side and a species of natural or
artificial objects on the other side, which objects are called the totems
of the human group.” The relation appears to be one of friendship
and kinship, on a footing of equality, not religious in Australia. I
have, in this chapter, drawn freely upon the great mass of facts and
speculations collected in <cite>Totemism and Exogamy</cite>; believing that in
that work the author not only intended to present the evidence for his
own conclusions, but had also the benevolent purpose of assisting the
labours of those who might come after him. A heavy debt of gratitude
is due; which, indeed, causes some embarrassment if ever one
feels obliged to differ from him in opinion.</p>

the author no longer approves of the word “reverenced.” Totem

distinguish those around them, before needing to name itself. It
follows that probably each group sometimes bore a different name
when spoken of by each of several neighbours. How amidst such
confusion could single names be fixed? Perhaps because the group
designated adopted one of them; or by the elimination of the other
names through many causes in course of time, in generations, in
hundreds of years. The march of progress was leisurely in those
days.</p>
